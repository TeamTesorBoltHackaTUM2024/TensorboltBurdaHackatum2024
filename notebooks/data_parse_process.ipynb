Indeed, as our own Conor Knell discovered during a test drive, the abrupt plunge from 70 to a 50 mph restriction is a reliable giveaway of who’s local and who’s not.\\n\\nNewcomers, he found, slam on their brakes in anticipation of imminent speed cameras while regulars steam on by, treating the legal limits as mere guidelines. It seems worlds away from Coventry\\'s rigorous streets where a host of average speed cameras rigorously enforce motoring discipline.\\n\\nCoventry motorists opened up about their experiences, with Conan the Mermaid reflecting: \"All the cars that I have driven in my 70+ years show the speed to be approximately 10% greater than the actual. This means when you think you are doing 50, you\\'re doing only 45. Thus the glares from the impatient others. Hope this helps.\"\\n\\nREAD MORE: Tribute to \\'devoted\\' dad in Coventry\\'s death and funeral notices this week\\n\\nPERCY adds: \"Yep driven down there and all cars pass me. We need average speed cameras on as many roads as possible. The difference is noticeable straight away, .and all you who hate them, carry on speeding, pay your fine then we\\'ll get more cameras, win win.\"\\n\\nMxlerone writes: \"What\\'s weird is that when they were building the new tollbar roundabout and flyover, that 50mph section had average speed cameras put in place and everything worked fine (or you received a fine). For some reason it must have been decided to allow the road to descend into anarchy through their removal instead.\"\\n\\nKenpas says: \"The reason the speed limit is 50mph on that part of the A46/A45, is the bend under the Toll Bar junction, as speeding vehicles are in danger of overturning under the junction. Also there is parking places built along that stretch for the mobile speed cameras to park up. I haven\\'t seen any mobile cameras on it yet!!\"\\n\\nDisorganised1 adds: \"Just drive around the ring road. I get overtaken daily driving at the speed limit, and on both sides of the car - often by private hire cars.\"\\n\\nMikehf comments: \"Never have any problem sticking to the speed limit.\"\\n\\nDestroyedcountry believes: \"Oh dear, anyone with a inch of common sense would never have set the speed limits as they are!\"\\n\\nOver on our Facebook page - Belle Barnes says: \"Excellent point and I don’t know why it’s not been called out before. I regularly drive on that road and I too follow the speed limit signs. They are there for a reason so when you feel like your the one in the wrong, the truth is that everyone else driving at 60/70 mph are in the wrong. I agree, it’s an accident waiting to happen. Maybe this article will make the highways agency or whoever deals with our roads, sort it out once and for all.\"\\n\\nWhile Saucey Sue adds: \"The 50mph stretch is round by the jaguar and A444/Warwick bypass where there are multiple lanes for different places, similar to the picture of the article above, as well as slip roads joining. It’s by far safer to reduce the speed limit than having everyone trying to achieve national speed limit whilst also trying to be in the correct lane. I guarantee there’d be people screaming about the number of accidents if the speed limit was 70. And remember people, a speed limit is not a target, it’s a maximum speed allowed.\"\\n\\nVicki Walls-Gilbert thinks: \"Well if you’re driving to the letter of the law you’ll be in the left hand lane and not be holding up anyone who wishes to speed as you’ll pull over as soon as you’ve over taken. Which leaves a lane free for the speedsters! You will also not travel in the right hand lane for miles, not over taking anything, often travelling way below the speed limit simply because you haven’t got the balls to change into the right hand lane as you approach your junction to turn right.\"\\n\\nSo do you believe that the limit is correct?

It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\\n\\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\\n\\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\\n\\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\\n\\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\\n\\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\\n\\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\\n\\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\\n\\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\\n\\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\\n\\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\\n\\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\\n\\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\\n\\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\\n\\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\\n\\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\\n\\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\\n\\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\\n\\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\\n\\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\\n\\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\\n\\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\\n\\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\\n\\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”\", 'extracted_data': {'summary': 'Ford has criticized the UK\\'s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which requires carmakers to sell more electric vehicles annually, calling it \"unworkable.\" This marks a shift from 2022 when Ford supported the policy.

Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\\n\\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\\n\\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\\n\\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\\n\\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: \"Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. \"The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. \"We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector.\" Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an \"urgent need\" to protect the sector.

For all Musk’s handwringing about “ballot harvesting”, he engaged in a brazen election interference scheme when he more or less paid citizens to vote for Trump.\\n\\nMusks’s so-called sweepstakes, which a Pennsylvania court waved through, culminates big money’s political playbook. Billionaires no longer need to launder their bribes through Super Pacs with vaguely patriotic names. They can avoid that rigmarole, cut out the middleman and offer direct financial incentives for supporting whichever candidate they deem most favorable to their business interests.\\n\\nAnd now that Musk’s doubtfully legal efforts have paid off in the election of the country’s first president with a felony conviction, the true singularity can begin – not the merging of humans with AI supposedly portended by Neuralink, but of Musk’s agenda with Trump’s. There’s no shortage of “catastrophic conflicts of interest”, to quote former chief of government ethics Walter Shaub. Sure enough, Musk’s corporate empire has received $15bn in public contracts, while facing 20 federal investigations. But it would be no more than coincidence should that first number skyrocket and the second number plummet over the next four years.\\n\\nThe Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently\\n\\nMore troubling than his informal heft as Trump’s self-proclaimed “first buddy”, though, is Musk’s appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency – which, as many have pointed out, somehow takes two people to lead. This glorified taskforce has a mandate to slash government costs, regulations and employment. With his typical spunk, Musk has pledged to eliminate a third of the $6.75tn federal budget, not unlike how he cut half of Twitter’s workforce.\\n\\nFortunately for Musk, that austerity doesn’t extend to his own bank account, which has received a generous Trump bump. Post-election Tesla stock surges have already earned him $70bn, and Musk’s appointment may also qualify him to receive a massive tax break. That seems only appropriate given that this faux department’s name abbreviates to Doge, a cryptocurrency that Musk owns “a bunch of”.\\n\\nNevertheless, the patent absurdity of the Musk-Trump pact just might offer a silver lining for Democrats. First, analysts and casual observers alike remain skeptical of how long the honeymoon can last between two narcissists whose power is exceeded only by their pettiness. Their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is perilous and fragile.\\n\\nSecond, Doge’s recommendations are just that: nonbinding. Trump himself has described Musk and Ramaswamy as offering “advice and guidance from outside of government”. That means the Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently.\\n\\nThis cuts both ways. The few worthy, populist ideas that could expand the Trump administration’s appeal – like reining in the Pentagon – will never get past a Republican House of Representatives. And if they dared touch entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, there won’t be a Republican House for much longer.\\n\\nMusk is clearly attempting to emulate Trump’s governing style. But Trump has consistently proven a more effective huckster than head of state. On the campaign trail, he was a Rorschach test: voters projected their grievances and aspirations on to his concepts of a plan. But a record is concrete.

It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\\n\\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\\n\\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\\n\\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston.

It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\\n\\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\\n\\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics.

The hydroplane was destroyed in 1967 when Campbell crashed in the Lake District as he attempted to push his own water speed record past 300mph (480km/h). Having been recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water 34 years later, it was rebuilt by a team of engineers on Tyneside. After a long-running ownership row, it was handed over to the Ruskin Museum, and now bosses say Australian Dave Warby, son of the late-water speed world-record holder Ken Warby, will be in the cockpit when it returns to the lake in 2026.\\n\\nMr Warby, a current world water speed record challenger, described it as a \"tremendous honour\". Calling Bluebird \"the most iconic water speed record boat in the world\", he said its exploits with Campbell at the controls had been the \"inspiration\" for his father to set his own world records in 1977 and 1978. His latter mark of 317mph (510km/h) still stands.\\n\\nDave Warby Dave Warby is aiming to break the water speed record in his own craft, Spirit of Australia II\\n\\nMr Warby\\'s reserve will be RAF Flt Lt David-John Gibbs, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, who is the designated pilot for the Longbow speed record attempt being led by Dave Aldred.

A legal row then ensued after Mr Smith claimed part-ownership due to the work he and his Bluebird Project (BBP) team had carried out. In the settlement agreed in January, when he relinquished his claim, Mr Smith paid £25,000 towards the Ruskin Museum\\'s legal costs. It was also agreed he would have no \"further right, title or interest\" in the craft. However, since then the BBP\\'s social media account has repeatedly called for the museum to put aside those terms and enlist the group\\'s volunteers to help with maintenance and any future running.\\n\\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

His commercial and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.\\n\\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for electric vehicles. This year, Musk formally endorsed Trump as the presidential candidate, campaigned for him online and off and donated more than $100m to his re-election effort.\\n\\nMusk’s loyalty has been rewarded with his appointment as the leader of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which, despite its name, will be an advisory body, not a government agency. But perhaps more important for the global economy than his official role will be the influence he has on the dynamic between the leaders of the world’s two superpowers. With a trade war that was started by Trump and expanded by Biden, and mounting geopolitical tensions, the US-China relationship has been tumbling downhill for years, with negative global consequences, not least for consumers in the US and China, who have seen prices rise as a result.\\n\\nUnlike the other figures in Trump’s newly appointed cabinet, such as China hawk Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state who has been hit with sanctions by Beijing, Musk has a cosy relationship with China’s top leaders.\\n\\nMusk has visited China several times, most recently in April, when he made a surprise trip to Beijing to convene with the Chinese premier Li Qiang. Last year, he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco.\\n\\nMusk’s relationship with Li, the second-highest ranking person in China, is especially close: Li was the party secretary for Shanghai in 2019, when Tesla opened its first overseas factory there, which is now Tesla’s biggest factory by output. It was built with loans of $521m from Chinese-state owned banks, which were issued at favourable interest rates. The Shanghai government gave Tesla a beneficial corporate tax rate of 15% between 2019 and 2023, lower than the standard 25%. Tesla also reportedly managed to become the first foreign auto company to be allowed to set up without a local partner.\\n\\nAnd construction has now started on a second $200m Tesla factory in Shanghai, which is expected to produce around 10,000 utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, called Megapacks, per year. Lithium batteries are one of China’s “new three” priority industries as Xi tries to pivot the economy towards high-tech, renewable infrastructure. The other two priority areas – EVs and solar panels – are also both Tesla products, though to a lesser extent regarding solar panels.\\n\\nWith large investments in two out of three of China’s economic priorities, Musk has been welcomed to the country with open arms. Reporting on the new battery factory in Shanghai, Chinese state media said: “Despite the US intensifying its crackdown on China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector, Tesla has chosen to further invest in China. This highlights industry leaders’ robust confidence in China’s high-tech advancement”.\\n\\nMusk is vocal about his support for the country – and its government – that many in Washington see as the US’s biggest threat. He has described China as “truly amazing” and tweeted his gratitude to the Chinese government for supporting Tesla’s business in China. The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the lion’s share of vehicle manufacturing capacity. The Shanghai factory has the capacity to make more than 950,000 cars a year, compared with more than 650,000 from the California plant.\\n\\nLeaders in China may therefore want to leverage their support for Tesla into concessions from the new Trump administration, via Musk.\\n\\nTrump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, eliciting ire from Beijing and exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Levies on Chinese electric vehicles are already 100%, something which Musk has criticised, while at the same time warning that Tesla will be “demolished” if not financially protected from the likes of BYD.\\n\\nTrump has pledged that US tariffs on Chinese EVs will to protect US carmakers. But the integrated nature of the EV supply chain, and China’s advanced position when it comes to battery technologies and the raw materials needed for EVs, means that few companies, including Tesla, can eliminate the need for Chinese parts in their products. For example, in October, following the latest round of US tariffs, which increased the levy on Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, Tesla’s Model 3 car became unavailable for sales in the US. The car uses batteries made by the Chinese company CATL.\\n\\nDaniel Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm, predicts that Musk will use his “bromance” with Trump to negotiate beneficial terms for Tesla and its interests in China, such as a exemptions for Tesla and other EV companies on batteries. Those negotiations may extend as far as tempering Trump’s trade war with China. “To have [Musk] there, it offsets a little of the hawkishness from Rubio and others,” Ives said.\\n\\n“I think there are going to be carve-outs for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China,” Ives said. “That’s why Musk being a big part of the Trump presidency is so important”.\\n\\nAdditional research by Jasper Jolly', 'extracted_data': {'summary': \"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has strong ties with both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, which may influence US-China relations amid ongoing trade tensions. Musk's relationship with Trump has strengthened, leading to his appointment as leader of the Department of Government Efficiency.
