        "content": "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        "content": "Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain's largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don't manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you'd like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate's 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: \"Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. \"The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. \"We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector.\" Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an \"urgent need\" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.",

During everyday driving, there will be 601bhp on tap, and the same 740Nm as before.\n\nAdvertisement - Article continues below\n\nAccordingly, performance is likely to be improved. 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds in the outgoing EV6 GT, and while Kia has not yet confirmed a figure for the upgraded model, we expect that extra power will have shaved at least a tenth of a second off the already impressive sprint time.\n\nThat would enable it to at least match the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N’s 3.4-second 0-62mph sprint, and come close to the Tesla Model 3 Performance’s time of roughly three seconds.\n\nThe only other detail Kia has confirmed so far is that the EV6 GT will get a new ‘Virtual Gear Shift’ feature, just like the Ioniq 5 N. It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel.",

From a clever inertial measurement unit to a bi-directional quick-shifter, this middleweight tourer is all set to make every ride smoother, safer, and—let’s be honest—cooler.\n\nSharper Safety Tech\n\nThe big headline here is the addition of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Fancy name, but what it does is dead clever: it brings cornering smarts to the traction control and ABS. Think of it as a guardian angel that steps in when the tyres scream for mercy—keeping you upright whether you’re hammering the brakes mid-lean or cracking open the throttle on a wet apex.\n\nEffortless Riding Experience\n\nThe bi-directional quick-shifter reminds you to forget the clutch, just flick through the gears and enjoy the ride. And there’s more wizardry on offer. Triumph’s connectivity system now comes as standard, letting you pair your phone via Bluetooth to keep an eye on calls, texts, and even navigation—all beamed onto a slick TFT screen.\n\nWith two new colours—Roulette Green and Crystal White—it’s like dressing the same sharp suit in a pair of trendy new ties. Simple but effective.\n\nPerformance That Delivers\n\nUnder the skin, the Tiger’s heart remains unchanged—and why fix what isn’t broken? The 660cc inline-three-cylinder engine churns out 80bhp at 10,250rpm and 6.5kgm of torque at 6,250rpm. Translation? It’s butter-smooth when you’re pottering through town, with a growl and punch that’s ready to pounce when the open road calls. Whether it’s city streets or alpine twists, the Tiger delivers with effortless charm.",

        "content": "It’s deja vu all over again, again. In the wake of Donald Trump’s decisive re-election, his transition team has moved to pack his cabinet and adviser positions with figures straight out of the Star Wars cantina – some of the most dangerous and bizarre sideshows from every corner of his chaotic galaxy.\n\nIn the Trump Cinematic Universe, loyalty usurps qualification. That’s why Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host who wants to eliminate “woke” officials from the military, got tapped to oversee our national defense. And it’s why Matt Gaetz was asked to helm the very Department of Justice that was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking, before his abrupt withdrawal from consideration.\n\nBut perhaps no figure better captures the cartoonish nature of Trump’s staffing philosophy than Elon Musk, the literal richest man on Earth, who has somehow grabbed the wheel of a presidential transition that’s navigating the road ahead about as well as one of his Teslas.\n\nFrom offering his two cents on presidential appointments, to joining calls with the Ukrainian president, to adjudicating the race for Senate majority leader via an X poll, the man who broke Twitter now has his sights set on breaking the federal government. He’s poised to hack the budget, ramrod in his half-baked policy musings and push through deregulation that will inevitably benefit his fleet of companies.\n\nLike any great romcom, Musk and Trump got off to a rocky start. Two years ago, before he donned a “dark gothic Maga” cap himself, Musk was urging Trump to “hang up his hat”, and Trump was calling Musk too chicken to buy Twitter. But then Musk did buy Twitter, and began diligently turning it into a bastion of rightwing misinformation called X.\n\nThe arc of this entanglement reached its inevitable conclusion when Musk rewired the platform’s algorithm to promote his own conspiracies about immigrants and election interference, while also giving free advertisement to Trump to the tune of 2bn views. Though Trump was already the first major party nominee to own a social media platform in Truth Social, he now essentially leases a second one for free.\n\nWhile Trump received support from Musk gratis, his voters received million-dollar checks. For all Musk’s handwringing about “ballot harvesting”, he engaged in a brazen election interference scheme when he more or less paid citizens to vote for Trump.\n\nMusks’s so-called sweepstakes, which a Pennsylvania court waved through, culminates big money’s political playbook. Billionaires no longer need to launder their bribes through Super Pacs with vaguely patriotic names. They can avoid that rigmarole, cut out the middleman and offer direct financial incentives for supporting whichever candidate they deem most favorable to their business interests.\n\nAnd now that Musk’s doubtfully legal efforts have paid off in the election of the country’s first president with a felony conviction, the true singularity can begin – not the merging of humans with AI supposedly portended by Neuralink, but of Musk’s agenda with Trump’s. There’s no shortage of “catastrophic conflicts of interest”, to quote former chief of government ethics Walter Shaub. Sure enough, Musk’s corporate empire has received $15bn in public contracts, while facing 20 federal investigations. But it would be no more than coincidence should that first number skyrocket and the second number plummet over the next four years.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently\n\nMore troubling than his informal heft as Trump’s self-proclaimed “first buddy”, though, is Musk’s appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency – which, as many have pointed out, somehow takes two people to lead. This glorified taskforce has a mandate to slash government costs, regulations and employment. With his typical spunk, Musk has pledged to eliminate a third of the $6.75tn federal budget, not unlike how he cut half of Twitter’s workforce.\n\nFortunately for Musk, that austerity doesn’t extend to his own bank account, which has received a generous Trump bump. Post-election Tesla stock surges have already earned him $70bn, and Musk’s appointment may also qualify him to receive a massive tax break. That seems only appropriate given that this faux department’s name abbreviates to Doge, a cryptocurrency that Musk owns “a bunch of”.\n\nNevertheless, the patent absurdity of the Musk-Trump pact just might offer a silver lining for Democrats. First, analysts and casual observers alike remain skeptical of how long the honeymoon can last between two narcissists whose power is exceeded only by their pettiness. Their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is perilous and fragile.\n\nSecond, Doge’s recommendations are just that: nonbinding. Trump himself has described Musk and Ramaswamy as offering “advice and guidance from outside of government”. That means the Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently.\n\nThis cuts both ways. The few worthy, populist ideas that could expand the Trump administration’s appeal – like reining in the Pentagon – will never get past a Republican House of Representatives. And if they dared touch entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, there won’t be a Republican House for much longer.\n\nMusk is clearly attempting to emulate Trump’s governing style. But Trump has consistently proven a more effective huckster than head of state. On the campaign trail, he was a Rorschach test: voters projected their grievances and aspirations on to his concepts of a plan. But a record is concrete. Soon enough, reality will sharpen into undeniable focus, one bad bromance at a time.",

        "content": "The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nPeter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.",

Hampshire followed closely behind, seeing claims rise from 750 to 2,654 over the same period. The Freedom of Information data from councils covering nearly 92,200 miles of local roads, highlight the growing crisis facing British motorists.\n\nDo you have a story you'd like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nLabour pledged an additional £500million in the Budget to fill in potholes PA\n\nDespite the surge in claims, councils are proving reluctant to compensate drivers for pothole damage. Data shows that 17 councils paid out just 15 per cent of the 20,432 claims submitted in 2023. The chances of successful compensation are particularly slim, with 13 councils refusing more than three-quarters of claims received. Five councils stood out for rejecting nine in 10 claims, with Gloucestershire County Council refusing 98 per cent of its 829 claims. Essex County Council turned down 95 per cent of its 2,560 claims, while Kent and Cornwall Councils both rejected 92 per cent of their claims. Only Shropshire Council showed a more generous approach, paying 68 per cent of its 546 claims in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe trend appears to be worsening, with the average number of refused claims rising from 76 per cent to 81 per cent between 2021 and 2023. The majority of rejected claims were thrown out because councils claimed they had no prior knowledge of the potholes. Of nine councils that provided detailed refusal data, 74 per cent of rejections - some 6,028 claims - were refused under Section 58 of the Highways Act 1980, which allows councils to reject claims if they were unaware of the pothole's existence. Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire councils took this approach to the extreme, citing a lack of prior knowledge for every single rejected claim.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams described the findings as \"a stark reminder that the ongoing poor condition of many of the UK's local roads is burning holes in the budgets of both local authorities and drivers\". He noted that some councils appeared to prioritise paying legal fees over settling claims, with £166,000 being spend to defend compensation claims. He said: \"The cost in time and money of defending claims appears to far outweigh the expense of reimbursing drivers for the damage done to their vehicle in the first place. \"Even if a driver successfully pursued compensation, the average sum paid out of £260 is often well below the cost to fix a pothole-damaged car, for anything more serious than a punctured tyre. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: SUV owners issued serious threat as climate protesters target 'monster' vehicles - 'Time to hold them to account'\n\nDrivers with larger petrol and diesel cars could face 'Land Rover tax' and new parking restrictions\n\n\n\nElderly motorists face strong calls to have 'mature driving assessments' and eyesight checks\n\nLabour pledged to repair one million more potholes per year in its manifesto PA",

Chapter 11 provides the company with the financing to focus on operational improvements and supporting customers, while allowing for restructuring, reorganization, and fundraising to secure a long-term competitive positioning. The company is also announcing that Peter Carlsson will take on a role as Senior Advisor and step aside from his role as CEO. He also remains a Member of the Board.\n\nPeter Carlsson has led Northvolt since its inception in 2016. He co-founded Northvolt with the mission to drive sustainable energy solutions through the creation of a pioneer in European battery production. Northvolt Ett is the first truly European battery gigafactory delivering to customers at large scale. Northvolt Labs is the epicenter of European battery research and development, achieving technical breakthroughs and leading in patent creation. In parallel, Northvolt is building groundbreaking facilities in Heide, Germany and Montreal, Canada, catering for a completely new industry in the Western economies.\n\nPeter Carlsson commented: “Today marks a significant new phase for Northvolt as well as for me personally. The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term. That makes it a good time for me to hand over to the next generation of leaders.\"\n\nNorthvolt’s Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tom Johnstone, commented: “We are incredibly thankful to Peter for his vision and dedication to building Northvolt from an unprecedented idea to becoming Europe’s battery manufacturing champion. Peter’s perspective will continue to benefit Northvolt, as a Senior Advisor and Member of the Board, while the new leadership will steer the company into the next stage.”\n\nThe company leadership will consist of Pia Aaltonen-Forsell, Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Arleth, the President of Cells, who will now take the role of Chief Operations Officer. Together, and supported by Scott Millar as Chief Restructuring Officer, they will jointly lead Northvolt. The search process for a new CEO has been initiated.\n\nTom Johnstone, added: “I am very pleased that the two recent additions to Northvolt’s leadership will jointly lead this next phase of operational improvement, increased customer focus, and financial restructuring.”\n\nThis transition underscores Northvolt’s commitment to adapting to an evolving market, with the new leadership focused on advancing the company’s goals of sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and continued innovation.

Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is fitted as standard to ensure the best possible safety during acceleration. The engine drag torque control is also standard. It prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nThe sound of the two-cylinder engine, which already has a powerful character due to the 270/450 degree firing interval, is made even throatier by the new sports silencer available as a genuine BMW Motorrad accessory (in cooperation with Akrapovič), which also offers a weight saving of approximately 1.2 kg.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload. New wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nBMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC as standard - for even more safety when braking.\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down telescopic forks with 43 mm slider tube diameter. Both rebound and compression damping as well as spring preload are now adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminium wheels. They weigh around 1.8 kg less than the previous models, contributing to a total weight reduction of 3 kg.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the new F models is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers even more safety when braking in bends by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides even greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration.\n\nNew, 0.8 kg lighter battery as standard and function-integrated turn indicator lights in the new rear end. BMW F 900 XR with Headlight Pro including daytime running light, adaptive headlight, USB-C charging port and heated grips as standard.\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 0.8 kg lighter. They also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights (brake and tail light functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights).\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR comes with Headlight Pro as standard, including daytime running light and adaptive headlight for even greater safety when riding at night. Other new standard features of the BMW F 900 XR include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and the heated grips.\n\nBMW F 900 R with optimised ergonomics thanks to a redefined position of the handlebars and footrests for a more sporty riding position. New headlight side trim painted in body colour.\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle between the handlebars, seat and footrests of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. This has made it possible to create a riding position that is significantly more sporty and closer to the front wheel.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R's increased sporting ambitions are emphasised by the headlamp side trim painted in body colour.\n\nBMW F 900 XR with optimised aerodynamics and hand protectors as standard.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR offers even more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimised aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet vibration and even greater riding comfort. The hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather.\n\nEquipment variants and colours.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R is available in three attractive colours. The basic variant is available in Snapper Rocks Blue metallic, the Triple Black version in Blackstorm metallic and the version Sport in Lightwhite with Racingblue metallic.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR will also be available in three variants and colours for the coming motorcycle season. The basic variant is available in Racing Red, the Triple Black version in Blackstorm metallic and the version Sport in Lightwhite with Racingblue metallic.\n\nNew optional equipment and genuine BMW Motorrad accessories for the new\n\nBMW R 900 and R 900 XR.\n\nThe already extensive range of optional equipment and genuine BMW Motorrad accessories has been further expanded for the new model year:\n\nBMW F 900 R and F 900 XR.\n\nSports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič.\n\nMilled footrests and foot levers.\n\nAxle protectors.\n\nLockable soft cases.\n\nMengine spoiler and passenger seat cover in new colours.\n\nBMW F 900 R.\n\nSport seat (+ 25 mm).\n\nBMW F 900 XR.\n\nHigh seat (+ 25 mm).\n\nHigh windshield (+ 30 mm).\n\nAll standard innovations as well as new genuine BMW Motorrad accessories and optional equipment at a glance:\n\nBMW F 900 R.\n\nComplies with Euro 5+ emission standards.\n\nNew ergonomics with optimised handlebar and footrest position for improved riding position.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload.\n\nNew wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nNew battery, approx. 0.8 kg lighter.\n\nDynamic Traction Control DTC, engine drag torque control, BMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC.\n\n\"Dynamic\" riding mode with new settings.\n\nSlim rear end with integrated turn indicator lights.\n\nNew colours.\n\nNew genuine BMW Motorrad accessories such as sports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič, milled footrests and foot levers as well as axle protectors and lockable soft cases.\n\nNew Sport seat (+ 25 mm seat height) available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW F 900 XR.",

        "content": "Pilot announced for Bluebird's return to water\n\nGetty Images It is six years since Bluebird was in action at Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute\n\nDonald Campbell's restored Bluebird K7 is to be piloted by the son of a world-record holder when it returns to the water. The hydroplane was destroyed in 1967 when Campbell crashed in the Lake District as he attempted to push his own water speed record past 300mph (480km/h). Having been recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water 34 years later, it was rebuilt by a team of engineers on Tyneside. After a long-running ownership row, it was handed over to the Ruskin Museum, and now bosses say Australian Dave Warby, son of the late-water speed world-record holder Ken Warby, will be in the cockpit when it returns to the lake in 2026.\n\nMr Warby, a current world water speed record challenger, described it as a \"tremendous honour\". Calling Bluebird \"the most iconic water speed record boat in the world\", he said its exploits with Campbell at the controls had been the \"inspiration\" for his father to set his own world records in 1977 and 1978. His latter mark of 317mph (510km/h) still stands.\n\nDave Warby Dave Warby is aiming to break the water speed record in his own craft, Spirit of Australia II\n\nMr Warby's reserve will be RAF Flt Lt David-John Gibbs, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, who is the designated pilot for the Longbow speed record attempt being led by Dave Aldred. Two Orpheus jet engines are to be refurbished as part of the plans to get Bluebird running again. Donald Campbell's Bluebird: The battle back to Coniston Setting seven world water speed records between 1955 and 1964, it was last on water in 2018 at Loch Fad, on Scotland's Isle of Bute, following a restoration led by North Shields engineer Bill Smith. A legal row then ensued after Mr Smith claimed part-ownership due to the work he and his Bluebird Project (BBP) team had carried out. In the settlement agreed in January, when he relinquished his claim, Mr Smith paid £25,000 towards the Ruskin Museum's legal costs. It was also agreed he would have no \"further right, title or interest\" in the craft. However, since then the BBP's social media account has repeatedly called for the museum to put aside those terms and enlist the group's volunteers to help with maintenance and any future running.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

It doesn’t look a lot different for 2025, but it should be a safer and more responsive and comfortable machine thanks to updates.\n\nFor starters, the safety features (traction control, ABS and even the headlight) are now cornering-sensitive. That adaptive headlight is a highly underrated safety feature and it is now included as standard, “seeing into” the corners for riders hustling along at night.\n\nThe suspension is new, and it’s completely adjustable to suit your riding style and terrain. And as always, BMW has a long list of accessories to bolt on: an official Akrapovic exhaust and lots more.\n\nBelow, see BMW’s official specs for the bike, followed by more photos.\n\nEngine Capacity cc 895 Bore/stroke mm 86.0 x 77.0 Output hp 105 @ 8,500 rpm Torque ft-lbs. 68.6 @ 6,500 rpm Type Water-cooled 2-cylinder inline engine with 4 valves per cylinder, two overhead camshafts and dry sump lubrication.

        "content": "If it pays to have friends in high places, few among us can claim to be better placed than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and one of the only people to have cosy relationships with both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. His commercial and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.\n\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for electric vehicles. This year, Musk formally endorsed Trump as the presidential candidate, campaigned for him online and off and donated more than $100m to his re-election effort.\n\nMusk’s loyalty has been rewarded with his appointment as the leader of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which, despite its name, will be an advisory body, not a government agency. But perhaps more important for the global economy than his official role will be the influence he has on the dynamic between the leaders of the world’s two superpowers. With a trade war that was started by Trump and expanded by Biden, and mounting geopolitical tensions, the US-China relationship has been tumbling downhill for years, with negative global consequences, not least for consumers in the US and China, who have seen prices rise as a result.\n\nUnlike the other figures in Trump’s newly appointed cabinet, such as China hawk Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state who has been hit with sanctions by Beijing, Musk has a cosy relationship with China’s top leaders.\n\nMusk has visited China several times, most recently in April, when he made a surprise trip to Beijing to convene with the Chinese premier Li Qiang. Last year, he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco.\n\nMusk’s relationship with Li, the second-highest ranking person in China, is especially close: Li was the party secretary for Shanghai in 2019, when Tesla opened its first overseas factory there, which is now Tesla’s biggest factory by output. It was built with loans of $521m from Chinese-state owned banks, which were issued at favourable interest rates. The Shanghai government gave Tesla a beneficial corporate tax rate of 15% between 2019 and 2023, lower than the standard 25%. Tesla also reportedly managed to become the first foreign auto company to be allowed to set up without a local partner.\n\nAnd construction has now started on a second $200m Tesla factory in Shanghai, which is expected to produce around 10,000 utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, called Megapacks, per year. Lithium batteries are one of China’s “new three” priority industries as Xi tries to pivot the economy towards high-tech, renewable infrastructure. The other two priority areas – EVs and solar panels – are also both Tesla products, though to a lesser extent regarding solar panels.\n\nWith large investments in two out of three of China’s economic priorities, Musk has been welcomed to the country with open arms. Reporting on the new battery factory in Shanghai, Chinese state media said: “Despite the US intensifying its crackdown on China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector, Tesla has chosen to further invest in China. This highlights industry leaders’ robust confidence in China’s high-tech advancement”.\n\nMusk is vocal about his support for the country – and its government – that many in Washington see as the US’s biggest threat. He has described China as “truly amazing” and tweeted his gratitude to the Chinese government for supporting Tesla’s business in China. The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the lion’s share of vehicle manufacturing capacity. The Shanghai factory has the capacity to make more than 950,000 cars a year, compared with more than 650,000 from the California plant.\n\nLeaders in China may therefore want to leverage their support for Tesla into concessions from the new Trump administration, via Musk.\n\nTrump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, eliciting ire from Beijing and exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Levies on Chinese electric vehicles are already 100%, something which Musk has criticised, while at the same time warning that Tesla will be “demolished” if not financially protected from the likes of BYD.\n\nTrump has pledged that US tariffs on Chinese EVs will to protect US carmakers. But the integrated nature of the EV supply chain, and China’s advanced position when it comes to battery technologies and the raw materials needed for EVs, means that few companies, including Tesla, can eliminate the need for Chinese parts in their products. For example, in October, following the latest round of US tariffs, which increased the levy on Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, Tesla’s Model 3 car became unavailable for sales in the US. The car uses batteries made by the Chinese company CATL.\n\nDaniel Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm, predicts that Musk will use his “bromance” with Trump to negotiate beneficial terms for Tesla and its interests in China, such as a exemptions for Tesla and other EV companies on batteries. Those negotiations may extend as far as tempering Trump’s trade war with China. “To have [Musk] there, it offsets a little of the hawkishness from Rubio and others,” Ives said.\n\n“I think there are going to be carve-outs for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China,” Ives said. “That’s why Musk being a big part of the Trump presidency is so important”.\n\nAdditional research by Jasper Jolly",
