        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

        'content': 'The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nPeter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'On the edge of the Arctic Circle, thousands of employees at Northvolt trudged to work on Friday morning, braving snow, slush and winter darkness, facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe company’s giant gigafactory, in the Swedish town of Skellefteå, remains operational for now. But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

        'content': 'The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nPeter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.',

Chapter 11 provides the company with the financing to focus on operational improvements and supporting customers, while allowing for restructuring, reorganization, and fundraising to secure a long-term competitive positioning. The company is also announcing that Peter Carlsson will take on a role as Senior Advisor and step aside from his role as CEO. He also remains a Member of the Board.\n\nPeter Carlsson has led Northvolt since its inception in 2016. He co-founded Northvolt with the mission to drive sustainable energy solutions through the creation of a pioneer in European battery production. Northvolt Ett is the first truly European battery gigafactory delivering to customers at large scale. Northvolt Labs is the epicenter of European battery research and development, achieving technical breakthroughs and leading in patent creation. In parallel, Northvolt is building groundbreaking facilities in Heide, Germany and Montreal, Canada, catering for a completely new industry in the Western economies.\n\nPeter Carlsson commented: “Today marks a significant new phase for Northvolt as well as for me personally. The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term. That makes it a good time for me to hand over to the next generation of leaders."\n\nNorthvolt’s Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tom Johnstone, commented: “We are incredibly thankful to Peter for his vision and dedication to building Northvolt from an unprecedented idea to becoming Europe’s battery manufacturing champion. Peter’s perspective will continue to benefit Northvolt, as a Senior Advisor and Member of the Board, while the new leadership will steer the company into the next stage.”\n\nThe company leadership will consist of Pia Aaltonen-Forsell, Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Arleth, the President of Cells, who will now take the role of Chief Operations Officer. Together, and supported by Scott Millar as Chief Restructuring Officer, they will jointly lead Northvolt. The search process for a new CEO has been initiated.\n\nTom Johnstone, added: “I am very pleased that the two recent additions to Northvolt’s leadership will jointly lead this next phase of operational improvement, increased customer focus, and financial restructuring.”\n\nThis transition underscores Northvolt’s commitment to adapting to an evolving market, with the new leadership focused on advancing the company’s goals of sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and continued innovation.

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated. During everyday driving, there will be 601bhp on tap, and the same 740Nm as before.\n\nAdvertisement - Article continues below\n\nAccordingly, performance is likely to be improved. 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds in the outgoing EV6 GT, and while Kia has not yet confirmed a figure for the upgraded model, we expect that extra power will have shaved at least a tenth of a second off the already impressive sprint time.\n\nThat would enable it to at least match the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N’s 3.4-second 0-62mph sprint, and come close to the Tesla Model 3 Performance’s time of roughly three seconds.\n\nThe only other detail Kia has confirmed so far is that the EV6 GT will get a new ‘Virtual Gear Shift’ feature, just like the Ioniq 5 N. It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel.',

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030.

        'content': 'If it pays to have friends in high places, few among us can claim to be better placed than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and one of the only people to have cosy relationships with both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. His commercial and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.\n\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for electric vehicles. This year, Musk formally endorsed Trump as the presidential candidate, campaigned for him online and off and donated more than $100m to his re-election effort.\n\nMusk’s loyalty has been rewarded with his appointment as the leader of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which, despite its name, will be an advisory body, not a government agency. But perhaps more important for the global economy than his official role will be the influence he has on the dynamic between the leaders of the world’s two superpowers. With a trade war that was started by Trump and expanded by Biden, and mounting geopolitical tensions, the US-China relationship has been tumbling downhill for years, with negative global consequences, not least for consumers in the US and China, who have seen prices rise as a result.\n\nUnlike the other figures in Trump’s newly appointed cabinet, such as China hawk Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state who has been hit with sanctions by Beijing, Musk has a cosy relationship with China’s top leaders.\n\nMusk has visited China several times, most recently in April, when he made a surprise trip to Beijing to convene with the Chinese premier Li Qiang. Last year, he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco.\n\nMusk’s relationship with Li, the second-highest ranking person in China, is especially close: Li was the party secretary for Shanghai in 2019, when Tesla opened its first overseas factory there, which is now Tesla’s biggest factory by output. It was built with loans of $521m from Chinese-state owned banks, which were issued at favourable interest rates. The Shanghai government gave Tesla a beneficial corporate tax rate of 15% between 2019 and 2023, lower than the standard 25%. Tesla also reportedly managed to become the first foreign auto company to be allowed to set up without a local partner.\n\nAnd construction has now started on a second $200m Tesla factory in Shanghai, which is expected to produce around 10,000 utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, called Megapacks, per year. Lithium batteries are one of China’s “new three” priority industries as Xi tries to pivot the economy towards high-tech, renewable infrastructure. The other two priority areas – EVs and solar panels – are also both Tesla products, though to a lesser extent regarding solar panels.\n\nWith large investments in two out of three of China’s economic priorities, Musk has been welcomed to the country with open arms. Reporting on the new battery factory in Shanghai, Chinese state media said: “Despite the US intensifying its crackdown on China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector, Tesla has chosen to further invest in China. This highlights industry leaders’ robust confidence in China’s high-tech advancement”.\n\nMusk is vocal about his support for the country – and its government – that many in Washington see as the US’s biggest threat. He has described China as “truly amazing” and tweeted his gratitude to the Chinese government for supporting Tesla’s business in China. The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the lion’s share of vehicle manufacturing capacity. The Shanghai factory has the capacity to make more than 950,000 cars a year, compared with more than 650,000 from the California plant.\n\nLeaders in China may therefore want to leverage their support for Tesla into concessions from the new Trump administration, via Musk.\n\nTrump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, eliciting ire from Beijing and exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Levies on Chinese electric vehicles are already 100%, something which Musk has criticised, while at the same time warning that Tesla will be “demolished” if not financially protected from the likes of BYD.\n\nTrump has pledged that US tariffs on Chinese EVs will to protect US carmakers. But the integrated nature of the EV supply chain, and China’s advanced position when it comes to battery technologies and the raw materials needed for EVs, means that few companies, including Tesla, can eliminate the need for Chinese parts in their products. For example, in October, following the latest round of US tariffs, which increased the levy on Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, Tesla’s Model 3 car became unavailable for sales in the US. The car uses batteries made by the Chinese company CATL.\n\nDaniel Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm, predicts that Musk will use his “bromance” with Trump to negotiate beneficial terms for Tesla and its interests in China, such as a exemptions for Tesla and other EV companies on batteries. Those negotiations may extend as far as tempering Trump’s trade war with China. “To have [Musk] there, it offsets a little of the hawkishness from Rubio and others,” Ives said.\n\n“I think there are going to be carve-outs for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China,” Ives said. “That’s why Musk being a big part of the Trump presidency is so important”.\n\nAdditional research by Jasper Jolly',

        'content': 'It’s deja vu all over again, again. In the wake of Donald Trump’s decisive re-election, his transition team has moved to pack his cabinet and adviser positions with figures straight out of the Star Wars cantina – some of the most dangerous and bizarre sideshows from every corner of his chaotic galaxy.\n\nIn the Trump Cinematic Universe, loyalty usurps qualification. That’s why Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host who wants to eliminate “woke” officials from the military, got tapped to oversee our national defense. And it’s why Matt Gaetz was asked to helm the very Department of Justice that was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking, before his abrupt withdrawal from consideration.\n\nBut perhaps no figure better captures the cartoonish nature of Trump’s staffing philosophy than Elon Musk, the literal richest man on Earth, who has somehow grabbed the wheel of a presidential transition that’s navigating the road ahead about as well as one of his Teslas.\n\nFrom offering his two cents on presidential appointments, to joining calls with the Ukrainian president, to adjudicating the race for Senate majority leader via an X poll, the man who broke Twitter now has his sights set on breaking the federal government. He’s poised to hack the budget, ramrod in his half-baked policy musings and push through deregulation that will inevitably benefit his fleet of companies.\n\nLike any great romcom, Musk and Trump got off to a rocky start. Two years ago, before he donned a “dark gothic Maga” cap himself, Musk was urging Trump to “hang up his hat”, and Trump was calling Musk too chicken to buy Twitter. But then Musk did buy Twitter, and began diligently turning it into a bastion of rightwing misinformation called X.\n\nThe arc of this entanglement reached its inevitable conclusion when Musk rewired the platform’s algorithm to promote his own conspiracies about immigrants and election interference, while also giving free advertisement to Trump to the tune of 2bn views. Though Trump was already the first major party nominee to own a social media platform in Truth Social, he now essentially leases a second one for free.\n\nWhile Trump received support from Musk gratis, his voters received million-dollar checks. For all Musk’s handwringing about “ballot harvesting”, he engaged in a brazen election interference scheme when he more or less paid citizens to vote for Trump.\n\nMusks’s so-called sweepstakes, which a Pennsylvania court waved through, culminates big money’s political playbook. Billionaires no longer need to launder their bribes through Super Pacs with vaguely patriotic names. They can avoid that rigmarole, cut out the middleman and offer direct financial incentives for supporting whichever candidate they deem most favorable to their business interests.\n\nAnd now that Musk’s doubtfully legal efforts have paid off in the election of the country’s first president with a felony conviction, the true singularity can begin – not the merging of humans with AI supposedly portended by Neuralink, but of Musk’s agenda with Trump’s. There’s no shortage of “catastrophic conflicts of interest”, to quote former chief of government ethics Walter Shaub. Sure enough, Musk’s corporate empire has received $15bn in public contracts, while facing 20 federal investigations. But it would be no more than coincidence should that first number skyrocket and the second number plummet over the next four years.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently\n\nMore troubling than his informal heft as Trump’s self-proclaimed “first buddy”, though, is Musk’s appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency – which, as many have pointed out, somehow takes two people to lead. This glorified taskforce has a mandate to slash government costs, regulations and employment. With his typical spunk, Musk has pledged to eliminate a third of the $6.75tn federal budget, not unlike how he cut half of Twitter’s workforce.\n\nFortunately for Musk, that austerity doesn’t extend to his own bank account, which has received a generous Trump bump. Post-election Tesla stock surges have already earned him $70bn, and Musk’s appointment may also qualify him to receive a massive tax break. That seems only appropriate given that this faux department’s name abbreviates to Doge, a cryptocurrency that Musk owns “a bunch of”.\n\nNevertheless, the patent absurdity of the Musk-Trump pact just might offer a silver lining for Democrats. First, analysts and casual observers alike remain skeptical of how long the honeymoon can last between two narcissists whose power is exceeded only by their pettiness. Their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is perilous and fragile.\n\nSecond, Doge’s recommendations are just that: nonbinding. Trump himself has described Musk and Ramaswamy as offering “advice and guidance from outside of government”. That means the Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently.\n\nThis cuts both ways. The few worthy, populist ideas that could expand the Trump administration’s appeal – like reining in the Pentagon – will never get past a Republican House of Representatives. And if they dared touch entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, there won’t be a Republican House for much longer.\n\nMusk is clearly attempting to emulate Trump’s governing style. But Trump has consistently proven a more effective huckster than head of state. On the campaign trail, he was a Rorschach test: voters projected their grievances and aspirations on to his concepts of a plan. But a record is concrete. Soon enough, reality will sharpen into undeniable focus, one bad bromance at a time.',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

And it’s likely to steal some of the upcoming electric Range Rover's thunder. The ginormous seven-seater EV is touted to come with 385 miles of range and adjustable six or seven-seat seating options\n\nThe main draw of this new large luxury EV is the spaciousness: there’s three rows to accommodate seven people but because of the flat floor you can also spec a six-seat option with two ‘Swivel Seats’ in the second row that turn to face the third row ‘to allow enhanced interaction and communication among passengers’ when the vehicle is stationary.\n\nThe first and second rows have ‘Relaxation Seats’ that fully recline, leg rests for optimal comfort and a ‘Dynamic Body Care system’ which includes a ‘Dynamic Touch Massage function’ for ‘reducing fatigue on long drives’.\n\nSitting within 1,899 mm of headroom and 2,050mm of legroom - thanks to the Ioniq 9’s 5.06m length, 1.98m width and 1.79m height – there's loads of space and a light, bright, natural feel thanks to the panoramic roof.\n\nAs well as a sliding ‘Universal Island 2.0’ centre console, which allows easy access to the second row and offers a total of 18.2-litres of storage space, there’s 620 litres of boot space with all seats up, and 1,323 litres with the third row folded down flat.\n\nThere’s also a handy 88-litre 'frunk' (front trunk under the bonnet).\n\nThere’s three rows to accommodate seven people but because of the flat floor you can also spec a six-seat option with two ‘Swivel Seats’ in the second row that turn to face the third row ‘to allow enhanced interaction and communication among passengers’ when the vehicle is stationary\n\nInfotainment-wise the dash has the same two side-by-side 12-inch screens along with wireless charging, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and AI voice assist\n\nThe RWD does 0-62mph in 9.4 seconds, the dual motor in 6.7 seconds and the AWD in 5.2 seconds\n\nAs well as a sliding ‘Universal Island 2.0’ centre console, which allows easy access to the second row and offers a total of 18.2-litres of storage space, there’s 620-litres of boot space with all seats up, and 1,323 litres with the third row folded down flat\n\nInfotainment-wise, the dash has two side-by-side 12-inch screens along with wireless charging, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and AI voice assist.\n\nThe family-friendly EV will be launched with three powertrains: A 215bhp, RWD Long-Range version offering 385 miles on a full charge; a 308bhp dual-motor variant with 320 miles; and the range-topping AWD Performance, with 429bhp and 311 miles.\n\nThe RWD does 0-62mph in 9.4 seconds, the dual motor in 6.7 seconds and the AWD in 5.2 seconds.\n\nYou also get 230V vehicle to load to power appliances off the car.\n\nIt will be launched with three power trains: A 215bhp, RWD Long-Range version with the 385-mile maximum range figure, a 308bhp dual-motor variant with 320 miles and the range-topping AWD Performance model, with 429bhp which manages 311 miles on a single charge\n\nAs well as being a contender for top luxury seven-seater the 110.3kWh battery puts the Ioniq 9 ahead of the Mercedes EQS and Rolls-Royce Spectre as the EV with the largest battery in the UK\n\nAs well as being a new contender for top luxury seven-seater, the 110.3kWh battery puts the Ioniq 9 ahead of the Mercedes EQS and Rolls-Royce Spectre as the EV with the largest battery in an EV sold in the UK.\n\nThe big head-to-head though will be with the forthcoming Range Rover Electric, which is due to be unveiled in the UK later this year.\n\nThe Range Rover is promised to come with 'comparable performance' to the existing V8 model, which should mean it comes with around 520bhp, as well as being the smoothest, quietest Range Rover yet.\n\nThe first all-electric Range Rover will have a 800V charging architecture, which will put it on par with the Hyundai Ioniq5 and Ioniq6 as well as the Porsche's Taycan, Kia's EV6 and EV9 SUV.\n\nBut with the Range Rover EV set to start from anything from over £100,000 (the starting price of the current Range Rover) to easily £150,000, the Ioniq 9 will very likely undercut this significantly.\n\nWhile we've already mentioned there's not set pricing yet, you can expect to pay from around £65k to over £80k for the range topping model - a nice chunk off the price of the Range Rover.",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

        'content': 'On the edge of the Arctic Circle, thousands of employees at Northvolt trudged to work on Friday morning, braving snow, slush and winter darkness, facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe company’s giant gigafactory, in the Swedish town of Skellefteå, remains operational for now. But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

The global market for battery-powered cars has slowed significantly in 2023, with European sales particularly weak, including an 18% drop in Germany.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'On the edge of the Arctic Circle, thousands of employees at Northvolt trudged to work on Friday morning, braving snow, slush and winter darkness, facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe company’s giant gigafactory, in the Swedish town of Skellefteå, remains operational for now. But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

        'content': 'The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nPeter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.',

        'content': 'Stockholm, Sweden – Today Northvolt embarks on a new phase through a Chapter 11 reorganization filing. Chapter 11 provides the company with the financing to focus on operational improvements and supporting customers, while allowing for restructuring, reorganization, and fundraising to secure a long-term competitive positioning. The company is also announcing that Peter Carlsson will take on a role as Senior Advisor and step aside from his role as CEO. He also remains a Member of the Board.\n\nPeter Carlsson has led Northvolt since its inception in 2016. He co-founded Northvolt with the mission to drive sustainable energy solutions through the creation of a pioneer in European battery production. Northvolt Ett is the first truly European battery gigafactory delivering to customers at large scale. Northvolt Labs is the epicenter of European battery research and development, achieving technical breakthroughs and leading in patent creation. In parallel, Northvolt is building groundbreaking facilities in Heide, Germany and Montreal, Canada, catering for a completely new industry in the Western economies.\n\nPeter Carlsson commented: “Today marks a significant new phase for Northvolt as well as for me personally. The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term. That makes it a good time for me to hand over to the next generation of leaders."\n\nNorthvolt’s Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tom Johnstone, commented: “We are incredibly thankful to Peter for his vision and dedication to building Northvolt from an unprecedented idea to becoming Europe’s battery manufacturing champion. Peter’s perspective will continue to benefit Northvolt, as a Senior Advisor and Member of the Board, while the new leadership will steer the company into the next stage.”\n\nThe company leadership will consist of Pia Aaltonen-Forsell, Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Arleth, the President of Cells, who will now take the role of Chief Operations Officer. Together, and supported by Scott Millar as Chief Restructuring Officer, they will jointly lead Northvolt. The search process for a new CEO has been initiated.\n\nTom Johnstone, added: “I am very pleased that the two recent additions to Northvolt’s leadership will jointly lead this next phase of operational improvement, increased customer focus, and financial restructuring.”\n\nThis transition underscores Northvolt’s commitment to adapting to an evolving market, with the new leadership focused on advancing the company’s goals of sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and continued innovation. The changes take place with immediate effect.',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

        'content': 'If it pays to have friends in high places, few among us can claim to be better placed than Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and one of the only people to have cosy relationships with both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. His commercial and political connections to both may prove pivotal as the feud between the US and China plays out over the next four years, particularly as Trump promises steep tariffs.\n\nMusk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, once supported Joe Biden. But his relationship with the current US president soured over the past four years as, among other insults, Musk felt that the White House gave Telsa, his car and green energy company, “the cold shoulder”. Trump, meanwhile, has described Tesla as “incredible” even while pledging to do away with subsidies for electric vehicles. This year, Musk formally endorsed Trump as the presidential candidate, campaigned for him online and off and donated more than $100m to his re-election effort.\n\nMusk’s loyalty has been rewarded with his appointment as the leader of a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which, despite its name, will be an advisory body, not a government agency. But perhaps more important for the global economy than his official role will be the influence he has on the dynamic between the leaders of the world’s two superpowers. With a trade war that was started by Trump and expanded by Biden, and mounting geopolitical tensions, the US-China relationship has been tumbling downhill for years, with negative global consequences, not least for consumers in the US and China, who have seen prices rise as a result.\n\nUnlike the other figures in Trump’s newly appointed cabinet, such as China hawk Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state who has been hit with sanctions by Beijing, Musk has a cosy relationship with China’s top leaders.\n\nMusk has visited China several times, most recently in April, when he made a surprise trip to Beijing to convene with the Chinese premier Li Qiang. Last year, he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in San Francisco.\n\nMusk’s relationship with Li, the second-highest ranking person in China, is especially close: Li was the party secretary for Shanghai in 2019, when Tesla opened its first overseas factory there, which is now Tesla’s biggest factory by output. It was built with loans of $521m from Chinese-state owned banks, which were issued at favourable interest rates. The Shanghai government gave Tesla a beneficial corporate tax rate of 15% between 2019 and 2023, lower than the standard 25%. Tesla also reportedly managed to become the first foreign auto company to be allowed to set up without a local partner.\n\nAnd construction has now started on a second $200m Tesla factory in Shanghai, which is expected to produce around 10,000 utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, called Megapacks, per year. Lithium batteries are one of China’s “new three” priority industries as Xi tries to pivot the economy towards high-tech, renewable infrastructure. The other two priority areas – EVs and solar panels – are also both Tesla products, though to a lesser extent regarding solar panels.\n\nWith large investments in two out of three of China’s economic priorities, Musk has been welcomed to the country with open arms. Reporting on the new battery factory in Shanghai, Chinese state media said: “Despite the US intensifying its crackdown on China’s new energy vehicle (NEV) sector, Tesla has chosen to further invest in China. This highlights industry leaders’ robust confidence in China’s high-tech advancement”.\n\nMusk is vocal about his support for the country – and its government – that many in Washington see as the US’s biggest threat. He has described China as “truly amazing” and tweeted his gratitude to the Chinese government for supporting Tesla’s business in China. The country accounts for around one-quarter of Tesla’s global revenues, and the lion’s share of vehicle manufacturing capacity. The Shanghai factory has the capacity to make more than 950,000 cars a year, compared with more than 650,000 from the California plant.\n\nLeaders in China may therefore want to leverage their support for Tesla into concessions from the new Trump administration, via Musk.\n\nTrump has promised to introduce 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports, eliciting ire from Beijing and exacerbating an already fractious relationship. Levies on Chinese electric vehicles are already 100%, something which Musk has criticised, while at the same time warning that Tesla will be “demolished” if not financially protected from the likes of BYD.\n\nTrump has pledged that US tariffs on Chinese EVs will to protect US carmakers. But the integrated nature of the EV supply chain, and China’s advanced position when it comes to battery technologies and the raw materials needed for EVs, means that few companies, including Tesla, can eliminate the need for Chinese parts in their products. For example, in October, following the latest round of US tariffs, which increased the levy on Chinese lithium-ion EV batteries from 7.5% to 25%, Tesla’s Model 3 car became unavailable for sales in the US. The car uses batteries made by the Chinese company CATL.\n\nDaniel Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm, predicts that Musk will use his “bromance” with Trump to negotiate beneficial terms for Tesla and its interests in China, such as a exemptions for Tesla and other EV companies on batteries. Those negotiations may extend as far as tempering Trump’s trade war with China. “To have [Musk] there, it offsets a little of the hawkishness from Rubio and others,” Ives said.\n\n“I think there are going to be carve-outs for Tesla when it comes to tariffs, as well for China,” Ives said. “That’s why Musk being a big part of the Trump presidency is so important”.\n\nAdditional research by Jasper Jolly',

        'content': 'It’s deja vu all over again, again. In the wake of Donald Trump’s decisive re-election, his transition team has moved to pack his cabinet and adviser positions with figures straight out of the Star Wars cantina – some of the most dangerous and bizarre sideshows from every corner of his chaotic galaxy.\n\nIn the Trump Cinematic Universe, loyalty usurps qualification. That’s why Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host who wants to eliminate “woke” officials from the military, got tapped to oversee our national defense. And it’s why Matt Gaetz was asked to helm the very Department of Justice that was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking, before his abrupt withdrawal from consideration.\n\nBut perhaps no figure better captures the cartoonish nature of Trump’s staffing philosophy than Elon Musk, the literal richest man on Earth, who has somehow grabbed the wheel of a presidential transition that’s navigating the road ahead about as well as one of his Teslas.\n\nFrom offering his two cents on presidential appointments, to joining calls with the Ukrainian president, to adjudicating the race for Senate majority leader via an X poll, the man who broke Twitter now has his sights set on breaking the federal government. He’s poised to hack the budget, ramrod in his half-baked policy musings and push through deregulation that will inevitably benefit his fleet of companies.\n\nLike any great romcom, Musk and Trump got off to a rocky start. Two years ago, before he donned a “dark gothic Maga” cap himself, Musk was urging Trump to “hang up his hat”, and Trump was calling Musk too chicken to buy Twitter. But then Musk did buy Twitter, and began diligently turning it into a bastion of rightwing misinformation called X.\n\nThe arc of this entanglement reached its inevitable conclusion when Musk rewired the platform’s algorithm to promote his own conspiracies about immigrants and election interference, while also giving free advertisement to Trump to the tune of 2bn views. Though Trump was already the first major party nominee to own a social media platform in Truth Social, he now essentially leases a second one for free.\n\nWhile Trump received support from Musk gratis, his voters received million-dollar checks. For all Musk’s handwringing about “ballot harvesting”, he engaged in a brazen election interference scheme when he more or less paid citizens to vote for Trump.\n\nMusks’s so-called sweepstakes, which a Pennsylvania court waved through, culminates big money’s political playbook. Billionaires no longer need to launder their bribes through Super Pacs with vaguely patriotic names. They can avoid that rigmarole, cut out the middleman and offer direct financial incentives for supporting whichever candidate they deem most favorable to their business interests.\n\nAnd now that Musk’s doubtfully legal efforts have paid off in the election of the country’s first president with a felony conviction, the true singularity can begin – not the merging of humans with AI supposedly portended by Neuralink, but of Musk’s agenda with Trump’s. There’s no shortage of “catastrophic conflicts of interest”, to quote former chief of government ethics Walter Shaub. Sure enough, Musk’s corporate empire has received $15bn in public contracts, while facing 20 federal investigations. But it would be no more than coincidence should that first number skyrocket and the second number plummet over the next four years.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently\n\nMore troubling than his informal heft as Trump’s self-proclaimed “first buddy”, though, is Musk’s appointment to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency – which, as many have pointed out, somehow takes two people to lead. This glorified taskforce has a mandate to slash government costs, regulations and employment. With his typical spunk, Musk has pledged to eliminate a third of the $6.75tn federal budget, not unlike how he cut half of Twitter’s workforce.\n\nFortunately for Musk, that austerity doesn’t extend to his own bank account, which has received a generous Trump bump. Post-election Tesla stock surges have already earned him $70bn, and Musk’s appointment may also qualify him to receive a massive tax break. That seems only appropriate given that this faux department’s name abbreviates to Doge, a cryptocurrency that Musk owns “a bunch of”.\n\nNevertheless, the patent absurdity of the Musk-Trump pact just might offer a silver lining for Democrats. First, analysts and casual observers alike remain skeptical of how long the honeymoon can last between two narcissists whose power is exceeded only by their pettiness. Their relationship, like Trump’s coalition at large, is perilous and fragile.\n\nSecond, Doge’s recommendations are just that: nonbinding. Trump himself has described Musk and Ramaswamy as offering “advice and guidance from outside of government”. That means the Department of Government Efficiency is not actually a department, nor is it government – so its proposals can be dispensed with efficiently.\n\nThis cuts both ways. The few worthy, populist ideas that could expand the Trump administration’s appeal – like reining in the Pentagon – will never get past a Republican House of Representatives. And if they dared touch entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, there won’t be a Republican House for much longer.\n\nMusk is clearly attempting to emulate Trump’s governing style. But Trump has consistently proven a more effective huckster than head of state. On the campaign trail, he was a Rorschach test: voters projected their grievances and aspirations on to his concepts of a plan. But a record is concrete. Soon enough, reality will sharpen into undeniable focus, one bad bromance at a time.',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated.

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun in twisty terrain, with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new BMW F 900 R as a Dynamic Roadster focuses primarily on sporty riding pleasure, the BMW F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on longer tours and holiday trips with luggage.\n\nPowerful two-cylinder in-line engine with Euro 5+ homologation. Dynamic riding mode with sportier set-up, Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control now standard. New sports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič as genuine BMW Motorrad accessories.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested two-cylinder in-line engine with 895 cc capacity and 77 kW (105 bhp) of power output ensures pleasurable riding dynamics. It also delivers a full-bodied torque curve in the current Euro 5+ homologation. With the newly tuned standard "Dynamic" driving mode, the two new F models offer even more riding pleasure and dynamics at a sporty pace. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is fitted as standard to ensure the best possible safety during acceleration. The engine drag torque control is also standard. It prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nThe sound of the two-cylinder engine, which already has a powerful character due to the 270/450 degree firing interval, is made even throatier by the new sports silencer available as a genuine BMW Motorrad accessory (in cooperation with Akrapovič), which also offers a weight saving of approximately 1.2 kg.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload. New wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nBMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC as standard - for even more safety when braking.\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down telescopic forks with 43 mm slider tube diameter. Both rebound and compression damping as well as spring preload are now adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminium wheels. They weigh around 1.8 kg less than the previous models, contributing to a total weight reduction of 3 kg.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the new F models is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro.

        'content': 'Triumph has unveiled its revamped Tiger Sport 660, sprinkling in enough upgrades to keep it sharp and seductive. From a clever inertial measurement unit to a bi-directional quick-shifter, this middleweight tourer is all set to make every ride smoother, safer, and—let’s be honest—cooler.\n\nSharper Safety Tech\n\nThe big headline here is the addition of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Fancy name, but what it does is dead clever: it brings cornering smarts to the traction control and ABS. Think of it as a guardian angel that steps in when the tyres scream for mercy—keeping you upright whether you’re hammering the brakes mid-lean or cracking open the throttle on a wet apex.\n\nEffortless Riding Experience\n\nThe bi-directional quick-shifter reminds you to forget the clutch, just flick through the gears and enjoy the ride. And there’s more wizardry on offer. Triumph’s connectivity system now comes as standard, letting you pair your phone via Bluetooth to keep an eye on calls, texts, and even navigation—all beamed onto a slick TFT screen.\n\nWith two new colours—Roulette Green and Crystal White—it’s like dressing the same sharp suit in a pair of trendy new ties. Simple but effective.\n\nPerformance That Delivers\n\nUnder the skin, the Tiger’s heart remains unchanged—and why fix what isn’t broken? The 660cc inline-three-cylinder engine churns out 80bhp at 10,250rpm and 6.5kgm of torque at 6,250rpm. Translation? It’s butter-smooth when you’re pottering through town, with a growl and punch that’s ready to pounce when the open road calls. Whether it’s city streets or alpine twists, the Tiger delivers with effortless charm.',

        'content': 'BMW Motorrad USA proudly presents the updated 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR. The new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR benefit from technical and visual upgrades as well as from significantly extended standard equipment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad takes its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new F 900 R focuses on sporty riding, the F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on both windy roads and on longer tours with luggage.\n\n“With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 6.6 lbs., we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the F 900 XR from optimized aerodynamics.”\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nEngine and Drivetrain\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR are even more dynamic and safer thanks to the new “Dynamic” riding mode and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), now standard.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested 895 cc two-cylinder in-line engine produces 105 hp and 68.6 lb-ft over a wide torque curve, while meeting current Euro 5+ homologation standards. With a 270/450 degree firing interval, the engine generates a very emotional exhaust note. The new sports silencer, available as a genuine BMW Motorrad Accessory in collaboration with Akrapovič, provides an even more expressive exhaust sound.\n\nThe F 900 R and F 900 XR are offered with two standard riding modes, Rain and Road. The optional Dynamic riding mode has received new settings. It has a throttle response curve that is more direct, making it ideal for sporty riding. Dynamic Traction Control DTC, which ensures a high level of riding safety, is also a new standard feature on both models. It contributes significantly to the high riding dynamics and exemplary riding safety. DTC provides valuable support and a significant safety advantage, especially in changing riding conditions, on surfaces with less grip and surfaces with changing friction.\n\nThe engine control unit detects a spinning rear wheel by comparing the speeds of the front and rear wheels via the ABS sensors with data from the lean angle sensor box. In this case, it reduces drive torque within milliseconds by reducing the ignition timing, intervening in the fuel injection system, and influencing the throttle position.\n\nDTC also uses a sensor cluster to measure the lean angle and takes this into account in its control behavior. DTC works with the different riding modes to ensure maximum riding safety.\n\nDTC provides valuable assistance and an enormous safety advantage when accelerating. However, it cannot redefine the physical limits of riding. It is still possible to exceed these limits through misjudgment or riding errors. However, DTC helps to make the most of the bike’s dynamic capabilities in a much safer manner. The DTC can be switched off separately for special requirements, such as riding on the track.\n\nIn addition to the anti-hopping clutch, the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR now feature standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control. This system prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nChassis and Suspension\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down 43 mm telescopic forks. In contrast to the previous models, the rebound, compression and spring preload are all adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements, operating conditions, and load conditions. Suspension travel is 5.3 inches (F 900 R) and 6.7 inches (F 900 XR).\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminum wheels from the S 1000 R model, which weigh around 3.9 lbs. less. The reduced rotational mass is reflected in improved acceleration, braking and handling. The wheel dimensions are 3.5 x 17″ front and 5.5 x 17″ rear with 120/70 ZR 17 and 180/55 ZR 17 tires.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the F 900 R and F 900 XR is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers more safety when braking in corners by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles. ABS Pro prevents the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly and reduces abrupt changes in steering force and thus the bike from returning to the upright position, even during sudden braking. The benefits are increased braking and riding stability combined with the best possible deceleration even when cornering.\n\nABS Pro is designed for road use, with medium to low friction values and optimum braking stability in the Rain and Road riding modes. Regulation takes place at an early stage. In Dynamic mode, ABS Pro assumes that the road surface has very high grip and has a high coefficient of friction. Accordingly, ABS Pro is designed for optimum deceleration, control is late and rear wheel lift detection is reduced.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration. As soon as the sensor cluster supplies a certain deceleration value during braking, any simultaneous desire to accelerate on the part of the rider is detected as implausible and throttle valve opening is suppressed. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance.\n\nElectronics\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 1.7 lbs. lighter. The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights. In keeping with the “all in one” concept, the short, lightweight number plate holder and the rear turn indicator and number plate lights form a single unit, while the brake and taillight functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights.\n\nThe new F 900 XR features Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight as standard. Other new standard features include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and heated grips.\n\nThe adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro, offers more safety when riding at night. This adds additional LED modules which allow for better illumination of the road in bends, ensuring a safer night-time ride. The adaptive headlight, which is unique in these two motorcycle classes, works by activating these additional LED elements in the main headlights, which are equipped with their own reflectors, depending on the lean angle. The adaptive headlight turns on when the motorcycle leans by more than 10 degrees and is travelling at a speed of more than 6 mph. The additional lighting effect functions optimally up to a lean angle of approx. 25°.\n\nThe F 900 XR has distinctive LED light guides to the left and right of the lower headlamp edge, indicating that it is part of the BMW Motorrad XR family.\n\nErgonomics and Design.\n\n“We have made the riding position on the new F 900 R even more sporty and dynamic with an optimized ergonomic triangle. The new F 900 XR benefits from optimized front fairing aerodynamics, which is reflected in a significant reduction in helmet shake.”\n\nDominik Menzel, Product Manager\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. The handlebars are positioned further forwards than on the previous model. A sportier, front-leaning riding position has been achieved by moving the footrests further back and optimizing the foot control positions.\n\nThe new F 900 XR offers more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimized aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet buffeting and even greater riding comfort.\n\nThe hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather. The new F 900 XR can also be fitted with a new, optional 1.18-inch higher windscreen.\n\nStandard and Optional Equipment\n\nLike all 2025 model year BMW motorcycle models, the new F 900 R and F 900 XR include the Ultimate Care Break-In Service, or “600 Mile Service” as standard. This included service further provides BMW customers with a truly premium experience.

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.',

        'content': 'Stockholm, Sweden – Today Northvolt embarks on a new phase through a Chapter 11 reorganization filing. Chapter 11 provides the company with the financing to focus on operational improvements and supporting customers, while allowing for restructuring, reorganization, and fundraising to secure a long-term competitive positioning. The company is also announcing that Peter Carlsson will take on a role as Senior Advisor and step aside from his role as CEO. He also remains a Member of the Board.\n\nPeter Carlsson has led Northvolt since its inception in 2016. He co-founded Northvolt with the mission to drive sustainable energy solutions through the creation of a pioneer in European battery production. Northvolt Ett is the first truly European battery gigafactory delivering to customers at large scale. Northvolt Labs is the epicenter of European battery research and development, achieving technical breakthroughs and leading in patent creation. In parallel, Northvolt is building groundbreaking facilities in Heide, Germany and Montreal, Canada, catering for a completely new industry in the Western economies.\n\nPeter Carlsson commented: “Today marks a significant new phase for Northvolt as well as for me personally. The Chapter 11 filing allows a period during which the company can be reorganized, ramp up operations while honoring customer and supplier commitments, and ultimately position itself for the long-term. That makes it a good time for me to hand over to the next generation of leaders."\n\nNorthvolt’s Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors, Tom Johnstone, commented: “We are incredibly thankful to Peter for his vision and dedication to building Northvolt from an unprecedented idea to becoming Europe’s battery manufacturing champion. Peter’s perspective will continue to benefit Northvolt, as a Senior Advisor and Member of the Board, while the new leadership will steer the company into the next stage.”\n\nThe company leadership will consist of Pia Aaltonen-Forsell, Chief Financial Officer, and Matthias Arleth, the President of Cells, who will now take the role of Chief Operations Officer. Together, and supported by Scott Millar as Chief Restructuring Officer, they will jointly lead Northvolt. The search process for a new CEO has been initiated.\n\nTom Johnstone, added: “I am very pleased that the two recent additions to Northvolt’s leadership will jointly lead this next phase of operational improvement, increased customer focus, and financial restructuring.”\n\nThis transition underscores Northvolt’s commitment to adapting to an evolving market, with the new leadership focused on advancing the company’s goals of sustainable growth, operational efficiency, and continued innovation. The changes take place with immediate effect.',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

        'content': 'On the edge of the Arctic Circle, thousands of employees at Northvolt trudged to work on Friday morning, braving snow, slush and winter darkness, facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe company’s giant gigafactory, in the Swedish town of Skellefteå, remains operational for now. But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

          'summary': 'Northvolt, a European battery manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy protection due to a cash crisis, despite raising over $15 billion since its founding in 2016. The company attributes its financial troubles to a decline in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe, which disrupted its business plan based on expected growth in the EV industry. The global market for battery-powered cars has slowed significantly in 2023, with European sales particularly weak, including an 18% drop in Germany.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

        'content': 'The chief executive of Northvolt has resigned, after the Swedish battery startup filed for bankruptcy protection in the US.\n\nPeter Carlsson, who has led Northvolt since 2016, will step aside with immediate effect, the company said on Friday. Carlsson said Northvolt, which is widely seen as a leading player in European efforts to build an electric vehicle battery industry, needs to raise between $1bn (£800m) and $1.2bn in order to restore the business.\n\nNorthvolt has built a factory in northern Sweden where it hopes to use green energy to produce hundreds of thousands of EV batteries each year. It was the most prominent of a host of European startups hoping to challenge the dominant Asian battery industry.\n\nHowever, the company has tipped into crisis in recent months as cash ran dry and it experienced problems getting its first factory up and running properly.\n\nNorthvolt on Thursday announced it would seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US after talks over rescue investments failed. It said it had enough cash to support operations for only about a week and it had secured $100m (£80m) in new financing for the bankruptcy process. It said operations would continue as normal during the bankruptcy.\n\n“Northvolt’s liquidity picture has become dire,” the company said in its Chapter 11 petition, filed in a bankruptcy court in Houston. Northvolt, which has operations in California, has about $30m in cash and about $5.8bn of debts.\n\nThe company, which employs about 6,600 staff across seven countries, expects to complete the restructuring by the first quarter of 2025.\n\nIn September, Northvolt said it would cut 1,600 jobs in response to “headwinds” blowing through the EV industry. It has also faced criticism for trying to build several factories at the same time, in Sweden, Germany and the US.\n\nWithin months, Northvolt has gone from a much-heralded startup to a company struggling to stay afloat by slimming down, and hobbled by production problems, the loss of BMW as an anchor customer and a lack of funding.\n\nEurope has been hoping that Northvolt would reduce western carmakers’ reliance on Asian rivals, which built their dominant position out of decades of experience in making batteries for consumer electronics. Industry leaders include China’s CATL and the EV and battery maker BYD, Japan’s Panasonic and South Korea’s LG.\n\nNorthvolt said the $100m was part of $245m in financing support for the bankruptcy. The Swedish truck maker Scania, a shareholder and its biggest customer, has said it will loan $100m to Northvolt to support the manufacturing of EV battery cells in Skellefteå, northern Sweden.\n\nCarlsson, who will remain as a “senior adviser” and a member of the board, said the company had been “like a baby” to him, but that it had struggled to ramp up production.\n\n“In hindsight, we were overambitious on the timing in which we could achieve it,” he added.\n\nThe investment group Vargas, a co-founder of Northvolt and one of its largest shareholders, said the bankruptcy would allow the company to address financial challenges and maintain its competitive edge in producing high-performance battery cells.\n\nBut EV demand is growing at a slower pace than some in the industry had projected, and competition remains stiff from China, which controls 85% of global battery-cell production, according to International Energy Agency data.\n\nThe Swedish deputy prime minister, Ebba Busch, said on X that the government continued to support the EV battery industry and hoped the restructuring would help turn around Northvolt’s fortunes.',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'Nissan has issued an urgent call for the UK Government to revise the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate rules, warning that manufacturers face significant penalties due to slower-than-expected electric vehicle sales.\n\nThe Japanese automaker, which operates Britain\'s largest car manufacturing plant in Sunderland, argues that outdated targets could force manufacturers to pay substantial fines or purchase credits from EV-only brands that don\'t manufacture in the UK.\n\nThe move comes as consumer demand for electric vehicles has failed to meet projected growth rates, putting pressure on car manufacturers to meet ambitious Government targets. This situation risks undermining UK automotive manufacturing and could threaten thousands of jobs and billions in investment, Nissan stated. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nNissan warned the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate could devastate manufacturers PA\n\nAccording to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), electric vehicle sales are projected to reach just 18.5 per cent of the total market this year. This falls significantly short of the ZEV mandate\'s 22 per cent target for 2024, with requirements set to increase further to 28 per cent in 2025. Targets will continue to rise in the coming years, with brands required to have 80 per cent of sales come from zero emission vehicles by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2035. Manufacturers have already attempted to boost sales through discounting measures, but consumer demand has remained below expectations.\n\nMissing these targets could result in manufacturers facing substantial penalties worth £15,000 per polluting vehicle over the threshold unless they purchase credits from EV-only brands. Nissan warned that since many EV-only manufacturers do not produce vehicles in the UK, British automotive companies would effectively be subsidising electric vehicle sectors in other countries. In response to these challenges, Nissan has proposed specific changes to the ZEV Mandate, including increased flexibility in borrowing credits from future years in the short term. The manufacturer also wants a two-year monitoring period for 2024 and 2025, replacing potential fines that could devastate the industry.\n\nGuillaume Cartier, Chairperson for the Nissan Africa, Middle East, India, Europe and Oceania (AMIEO) region, said: "Nissan has consistently supported the aims of the UK’s ZEV mandate and have been working with Governments and partners towards a fully electric future since the first Nissan LEAF arrived in 2010. "The mandate risks undermining the business case for manufacturing cars in the UK, and the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment. "We now need to see urgent action from the Government by the end of the year to avoid a potentially irreversible impact on the UK automotive sector." Cartier added that it was committed to working with the Government and industry partners to achieve goals, adding that there was an "urgent need" to protect the sector.

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

Indeed, as our own Conor Knell discovered during a test drive, the abrupt plunge from 70 to a 50 mph restriction is a reliable giveaway of who’s local and who’s not.\n\nNewcomers, he found, slam on their brakes in anticipation of imminent speed cameras while regulars steam on by, treating the legal limits as mere guidelines. It seems worlds away from Coventry\'s rigorous streets where a host of average speed cameras rigorously enforce motoring discipline.\n\nCoventry motorists opened up about their experiences, with Conan the Mermaid reflecting: "All the cars that I have driven in my 70+ years show the speed to be approximately 10% greater than the actual. This means when you think you are doing 50, you\'re doing only 45. Thus the glares from the impatient others. Hope this helps."\n\nREAD MORE: Tribute to \'devoted\' dad in Coventry\'s death and funeral notices this week\n\nPERCY adds: "Yep driven down there and all cars pass me. We need average speed cameras on as many roads as possible. The difference is noticeable straight away, .and all you who hate them, carry on speeding, pay your fine then we\'ll get more cameras, win win."\n\nMxlerone writes: "What\'s weird is that when they were building the new tollbar roundabout and flyover, that 50mph section had average speed cameras put in place and everything worked fine (or you received a fine). For some reason it must have been decided to allow the road to descend into anarchy through their removal instead."\n\nKenpas says: "The reason the speed limit is 50mph on that part of the A46/A45, is the bend under the Toll Bar junction, as speeding vehicles are in danger of overturning under the junction. Also there is parking places built along that stretch for the mobile speed cameras to park up. I haven\'t seen any mobile cameras on it yet!!"\n\nDisorganised1 adds: "Just drive around the ring road. I get overtaken daily driving at the speed limit, and on both sides of the car - often by private hire cars."\n\nMikehf comments: "Never have any problem sticking to the speed limit."\n\nDestroyedcountry believes: "Oh dear, anyone with a inch of common sense would never have set the speed limits as they are!"\n\nOver on our Facebook page - Belle Barnes says: "Excellent point and I don’t know why it’s not been called out before. I regularly drive on that road and I too follow the speed limit signs. They are there for a reason so when you feel like your the one in the wrong, the truth is that everyone else driving at 60/70 mph are in the wrong. I agree, it’s an accident waiting to happen. Maybe this article will make the highways agency or whoever deals with our roads, sort it out once and for all."\n\nWhile Saucey Sue adds: "The 50mph stretch is round by the jaguar and A444/Warwick bypass where there are multiple lanes for different places, similar to the picture of the article above, as well as slip roads joining. It’s by far safer to reduce the speed limit than having everyone trying to achieve national speed limit whilst also trying to be in the correct lane. I guarantee there’d be people screaming about the number of accidents if the speed limit was 70. And remember people, a speed limit is not a target, it’s a maximum speed allowed."\n\nVicki Walls-Gilbert thinks: "Well if you’re driving to the letter of the law you’ll be in the left hand lane and not be holding up anyone who wishes to speed as you’ll pull over as soon as you’ve over taken. Which leaves a lane free for the speedsters! You will also not travel in the right hand lane for miles, not over taking anything, often travelling way below the speed limit simply because you haven’t got the balls to change into the right hand lane as you approach your junction to turn right."\n\nSo do you believe that the limit is correct?

Hampshire followed closely behind, seeing claims rise from 750 to 2,654 over the same period.

Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nLabour pledged an additional £500million in the Budget to fill in potholes PA\n\nDespite the surge in claims, councils are proving reluctant to compensate drivers for pothole damage. Data shows that 17 councils paid out just 15 per cent of the 20,432 claims submitted in 2023. The chances of successful compensation are particularly slim, with 13 councils refusing more than three-quarters of claims received. Five councils stood out for rejecting nine in 10 claims, with Gloucestershire County Council refusing 98 per cent of its 829 claims. Essex County Council turned down 95 per cent of its 2,560 claims, while Kent and Cornwall Councils both rejected 92 per cent of their claims. Only Shropshire Council showed a more generous approach, paying 68 per cent of its 546 claims in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe trend appears to be worsening, with the average number of refused claims rising from 76 per cent to 81 per cent between 2021 and 2023. The majority of rejected claims were thrown out because councils claimed they had no prior knowledge of the potholes. Of nine councils that provided detailed refusal data, 74 per cent of rejections - some 6,028 claims - were refused under Section 58 of the Highways Act 1980, which allows councils to reject claims if they were unaware of the pothole\'s existence. Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire councils took this approach to the extreme, citing a lack of prior knowledge for every single rejected claim.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams described the findings as "a stark reminder that the ongoing poor condition of many of the UK\'s local roads is burning holes in the budgets of both local authorities and drivers". He noted that some councils appeared to prioritise paying legal fees over settling claims, with £166,000 being spend to defend compensation claims. He said: "The cost in time and money of defending claims appears to far outweigh the expense of reimbursing drivers for the damage done to their vehicle in the first place. "Even if a driver successfully pursued compensation, the average sum paid out of £260 is often well below the cost to fix a pothole-damaged car, for anything more serious than a punctured tyre.

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated.

It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel.',

        'content': "Two rare classic cars hidden away in a rural barns for 40 years have fetched tens of thousands of pounds at auction.\n\nThe two five-figure cars - a 1921 Talbot Darracq and a 1952 Mercedes Benz 220 Type A convertible - were discovered in Framlingham, Suffolk after their owner died.\n\nThe white Mercedes covered in a thin veil of dust sold for £37,000 while the green Talbot bagged for £10,500.\n\nBoth exceeded their estimated sale prices, with the Mercedes and Talbot valued between £30,000 to £35,000 and £6,000 to £8,000 respectively.\n\nThe classic green car was originally purchased by its late owner in 1967 for £750, whilst he served in the British Army in Germany.\n\nThe man had even preserved the original receipt of his beloved vehicle which had travelled with him through his time in the military.\n\nHe continued to drive both antique cars up until the 1980s, but for the last four decades they remained tucked away in his barn.\n\nThe two valuable vehicles were purchased at Reeman Dansie Auctions in Colchester, Essex, on November 16.\n\nThis 1952 convertible Mercedes Benz 220 Type stored in a barn in Framlingham, Suffolk, fetched £10,500 at auction\n\nAnd the 1921 Talbot Darracq was sold for £37,000 at auction\n\nThe Talbot had been purchased in 1967 for £750 - with the original receipt and cheque intact\n\nThe wwo rare classic cars that were stored in a rural barn for 40 years\n\nA Reeman Dansie spokesperson said: 'The left hand drive Mercedes was originally purchased by the late owner, whilst he was serving in the British Army in Germany, with the much loved car travelling with him during his military career.\n\n'It also saw life in Cyprus and the Middle East, before he undertook an epic journey across the continent to bring the car back to Blighty.\n\n'The 1921 Talbot - Darracq was purchased from C. J. Bendall Ltd in Hitchin in February 1967 at a cost of £750.00.\n\n'The original purchase receipt and cheque remains with a photograph of the late owner and his wife standing proudly beside their new purchase.\n\n'We understand from the late owner's family that the cars were last running in the 1980s and have remained preserved in his barn for the last four decades.'\n\nThe discovery of the hidden jewels comes shortly after a hoard of classic cars were found in a rural warehouse in Wales - worth an estimated £1 million.\n\nThe motor graveyard, which was packed out with iconic yet rusting cars such as Bentleys, Jaguars, a Porsche and even a Rolls-Royce, were found earlier this year.\n\nBut the epic treasure trove had seen better days, with many cars drowned in a veil of dust and rust, while others were missing doors and had plants growing through their mechanisms.\n\nHowever urban explorer, Daniel Sims, who refused to disclose the location of where he found the cars, believed their historic and sentimental value was upwards of £1million.\n\nThe 35-year-old, divulged there must have been more than 100 vehicles hidden away in the building, which he has documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality.\n\nHe said: 'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself.\n\nA motor graveyard filled with Rolls Royce, Jaguar and Porsche cars have been found withering away in a warehouse in Wales\n\nThe collection - worth up to a staggering £1 million - is every car enthusiasts dream\n\nHowever many of the antique cars have seen better days with many hidden away behind plants, or gathering dust as they rot away in the warehouse\n\n'I don't know anything about the history of the place other than whoever has been collecting these cars for decades and has an impressive collection which they must be proud of.\n\n'The cars were visible from the roadside so once on a field it was open access as the back of the property fence had fallen down.\n\n'We were quite nervous as we didn't know the backstory of this place apart from it containing a car graveyard with classic cars and from what we saw must have been over 100 hidden away here.\n\n'The place itself is a little overgrown at the back with rust and decay setting into the vehicles. Some were stored away meaning the damage to these amazing vehicles was minimal which is crazy to see.\n\n'Iconic cars such as Bentleys, Porsche, Peugeot 205 GTI , various Mercedes, MGs and quite a few imports from different countries are hidden here and would be worth a minimum from what I saw over £500,000 to £1,000,000 just off basic calculations.'\n\nOther vehicles found inside include Land Rover Defenders, Jaguars, Morris Minor 1100, a Rolls-Royce, MG MGA 1960, Mercedes-Benz, Triumph, Jaguar MK1, Mini Coopers, MG MG B, Cadillac Eldorado and a Volkswagen caddy.\n\n'I love taking photos of different things and items and dramatic places such as this and showing how these places and items end up,' Mr Sims added.\n\n'For a lot of people, these iconic cars will hold a lot of memories.\n\nUrban explorer Daniel Sims, made the astonishing find but is refusing to reveal the location of the warehouse for fear of attracting looters\n\nHehas documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality - and is under the impression the loot could be worth around £1million\n\nSeveral Mercedes, MGs, MG Midgets, Land Rover Discoveries, Volkswagens were found among the rusting vehicles\n\n'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself,' Mr Sims said\n\n'There were no scary moments but we were interrupted towards the end of the exploration by some locals who were worried we could be burglars as there had been some rural crime taking place in the area recently.\n\n'We explained how we were photographers and moved on from the area.\n\n'Just the sheer amount of vehicles collected which is rare to see and was a real treat to see so many iconic cars collected here.'\n\nHowever it isn't the first time urban explorers have discovered a treasure trove of vehicles, as two upon this car graveyard that is filled with hundreds of classic motors last year.\n\nMatt, 43, from Sheffield, and Andy, 56, from Doncaster - both YouTubers - journeyed to the secretive location in Suffolk.\n\nThey originally wanted to explore an abandoned house, but ended up stumbling across a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nThe pair documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel, FindersBeepers, where they showcased the goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and reclaimed by the earth.\n\nMatt said: 'After doing a lot of research on Google Earth, Andy came across the typical signs of an abandoned house only to go on to find a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nHoards of clutter filling one side of the barn which is packed with antique cars\n\nA micro car next to a Fiat Coupe, both of which have been left rotting away among the hidden collection located somewhere in Wales\n\nSeveral cars estimated to be worth thousands lined up rusting away in unison, hidden from public view\n\nA picture of the barn where the vehicles are held from the exterior\n\n'We were desperate to document them before they were lost to decay.\n\n'The nostalgia around old cars is huge and our viewers loved that seeing some of the classics brought back strong memories from their childhood. That's one of the main reasons why we make our videos.\n\n'I was a massive fan of the Jowett Javelin, however, Andy favoured the Ford Prefect. There are hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cars in that place even if it was for parts on some of them.\n\n'There were around 100 cars across the property,' he added.\n\n'It's hard to know the backstory of all the abandoned places we go. We mostly research as we go but on this occasion, there was very little to find out.'\n\nIn 2022, an urban explorer discovered a mystery classic car collection just thirty miles from Edinburgh, Scotland - as sixty year old cars were being left to rust.\n\nJaguars and Austins accounted for the majority of vehicles at this location which may be concealing some rare, hidden gems.\n\nIt's believed that the classic motors were collected by an unknown Jaguar enthusiast.\n\nSome of those vehicles dating back to the sixties and were in a sorry state. However, back in the day, the motors were highly sought after.\n\nAt the time, Jaguars were very fashionable, seen gracing the tracks at the infamous Le Mans race, and cost up to £45,000 in today's currency value.\n\nFinders Beepers' Matt Nadin and Andy Thompson exploring the car graveyard with over a hundred classic cars in 2023\n\nThe duo found a car graveyard filled with hundreds of classic motors that time has forgotten\n\nMany of the vehicles were stored carefully in a garage, with dozens of others outside\n\nAn old Bentley S2 was among the litany of rusted vehicles left outside the property\n\nThe rusted front grill of a classic automobile outside the abandoned house in Suffolk\n\nOutside the barn was a field which was also rammed with classic vehicles\n\nFindersBeepers showcased the goldmine of old classic cars on their Youtube channel\n\nMany of the vehicles would be worth tens of thousands of pounds\n\nFinders Beepers documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel\n\nThe goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and were left dormant in the field\n\nIn 2016, a mountain of abandoned cars from the 1970s were found 200ft below ground in an abandoned slate mine.\n\nUp to 100 cars in various condition were discovered cascading down the inside of the cave in Ceredigion, Wales.\n\nUrban explorers made a treacherous journey through darkness, in dangerous conditions and were stunned to find a car graveyard at the mine, which closed in 1960.\n\nIT Engineer Gregory Rivolet, 31, spent four hours exploring this unlikely last resting place for abandoned vehicles.\n\n'It was very dangerous as the mine is really unstable. Pieces of slate were falling from above our heads,' he said.\n\n'We had to use rope to climb down to the right level of the mine, the descent was around sixty-five feet deep, it didn't feel very secure at all.'",

        'content': '"With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 3 kilograms, we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new BMW F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the BMW F 900 XR from optimised aerodynamics."\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR: Technical and visual upgrades and significantly extended standard equipment for the dynamic roadster and long-distance sports bike in the mid-range segment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new BMW F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad is taking its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun in twisty terrain, with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new BMW F 900 R as a Dynamic Roadster focuses primarily on sporty riding pleasure, the BMW F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on longer tours and holiday trips with luggage.\n\nPowerful two-cylinder in-line engine with Euro 5+ homologation. Dynamic riding mode with sportier set-up, Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control now standard. New sports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič as genuine BMW Motorrad accessories.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested two-cylinder in-line engine with 895 cc capacity and 77 kW (105 bhp) of power output ensures pleasurable riding dynamics. It also delivers a full-bodied torque curve in the current Euro 5+ homologation. With the newly tuned standard "Dynamic" driving mode, the two new F models offer even more riding pleasure and dynamics at a sporty pace. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is fitted as standard to ensure the best possible safety during acceleration. The engine drag torque control is also standard. It prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nThe sound of the two-cylinder engine, which already has a powerful character due to the 270/450 degree firing interval, is made even throatier by the new sports silencer available as a genuine BMW Motorrad accessory (in cooperation with Akrapovič), which also offers a weight saving of approximately 1.2 kg.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload. New wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nBMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC as standard - for even more safety when braking.\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down telescopic forks with 43 mm slider tube diameter. Both rebound and compression damping as well as spring preload are now adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminium wheels. They weigh around 1.8 kg less than the previous models, contributing to a total weight reduction of 3 kg.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the new F models is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers even more safety when braking in bends by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides even greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration.\n\nNew, 0.8 kg lighter battery as standard and function-integrated turn indicator lights in the new rear end. BMW F 900 XR with Headlight Pro including daytime running light, adaptive headlight, USB-C charging port and heated grips as standard.\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 0.8 kg lighter. They also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights (brake and tail light functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights).\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR comes with Headlight Pro as standard, including daytime running light and adaptive headlight for even greater safety when riding at night. Other new standard features of the BMW F 900 XR include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and the heated grips.\n\nBMW F 900 R with optimised ergonomics thanks to a redefined position of the handlebars and footrests for a more sporty riding position. New headlight side trim painted in body colour.\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle between the handlebars, seat and footrests of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. This has made it possible to create a riding position that is significantly more sporty and closer to the front wheel.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R\'s increased sporting ambitions are emphasised by the headlamp side trim painted in body colour.\n\nBMW F 900 XR with optimised aerodynamics and hand protectors as standard.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR offers even more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimised aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet vibration and even greater riding comfort. The hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather.\n\nEquipment variants and colours.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R is available in three attractive colours. The basic variant is available in Snapper Rocks Blue metallic, the Triple Black version in Blackstorm metallic and the version Sport in Lightwhite with Racingblue metallic.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR will also be available in three variants and colours for the coming motorcycle season. The basic variant is available in Racing Red, the Triple Black version in Blackstorm metallic and the version Sport in Lightwhite with Racingblue metallic.\n\nNew optional equipment and genuine BMW Motorrad accessories for the new\n\nBMW R 900 and R 900 XR.\n\nThe already extensive range of optional equipment and genuine BMW Motorrad accessories has been further expanded for the new model year:\n\nBMW F 900 R and F 900 XR.\n\nSports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič.\n\nMilled footrests and foot levers.\n\nAxle protectors.\n\nLockable soft cases.\n\nMengine spoiler and passenger seat cover in new colours.\n\nBMW F 900 R.\n\nSport seat (+ 25 mm).\n\nBMW F 900 XR.\n\nHigh seat (+ 25 mm).\n\nHigh windshield (+ 30 mm).\n\nAll standard innovations as well as new genuine BMW Motorrad accessories and optional equipment at a glance:\n\nBMW F 900 R.\n\nComplies with Euro 5+ emission standards.\n\nNew ergonomics with optimised handlebar and footrest position for improved riding position.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload.\n\nNew wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nNew battery, approx. 0.8 kg lighter.\n\nDynamic Traction Control DTC, engine drag torque control, BMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC.\n\n"Dynamic" riding mode with new settings.\n\nSlim rear end with integrated turn indicator lights.\n\nNew colours.\n\nNew genuine BMW Motorrad accessories such as sports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič, milled footrests and foot levers as well as axle protectors and lockable soft cases.\n\nNew Sport seat (+ 25 mm seat height) available as optional equipment ex works.\n\nBMW F 900 XR.',

        'content': 'BMW Motorrad USA proudly presents the updated 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR. The new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR benefit from technical and visual upgrades as well as from significantly extended standard equipment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad takes its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new F 900 R focuses on sporty riding, the F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on both windy roads and on longer tours with luggage.\n\n“With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 6.6 lbs., we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the F 900 XR from optimized aerodynamics.”\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nEngine and Drivetrain\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR are even more dynamic and safer thanks to the new “Dynamic” riding mode and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), now standard.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested 895 cc two-cylinder in-line engine produces 105 hp and 68.6 lb-ft over a wide torque curve, while meeting current Euro 5+ homologation standards. With a 270/450 degree firing interval, the engine generates a very emotional exhaust note. The new sports silencer, available as a genuine BMW Motorrad Accessory in collaboration with Akrapovič, provides an even more expressive exhaust sound.\n\nThe F 900 R and F 900 XR are offered with two standard riding modes, Rain and Road. The optional Dynamic riding mode has received new settings. It has a throttle response curve that is more direct, making it ideal for sporty riding. Dynamic Traction Control DTC, which ensures a high level of riding safety, is also a new standard feature on both models. It contributes significantly to the high riding dynamics and exemplary riding safety. DTC provides valuable support and a significant safety advantage, especially in changing riding conditions, on surfaces with less grip and surfaces with changing friction.\n\nThe engine control unit detects a spinning rear wheel by comparing the speeds of the front and rear wheels via the ABS sensors with data from the lean angle sensor box. In this case, it reduces drive torque within milliseconds by reducing the ignition timing, intervening in the fuel injection system, and influencing the throttle position.\n\nDTC also uses a sensor cluster to measure the lean angle and takes this into account in its control behavior. DTC works with the different riding modes to ensure maximum riding safety.\n\nDTC provides valuable assistance and an enormous safety advantage when accelerating. However, it cannot redefine the physical limits of riding. It is still possible to exceed these limits through misjudgment or riding errors. However, DTC helps to make the most of the bike’s dynamic capabilities in a much safer manner. The DTC can be switched off separately for special requirements, such as riding on the track.\n\nIn addition to the anti-hopping clutch, the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR now feature standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control. This system prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nChassis and Suspension\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down 43 mm telescopic forks. In contrast to the previous models, the rebound, compression and spring preload are all adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements, operating conditions, and load conditions. Suspension travel is 5.3 inches (F 900 R) and 6.7 inches (F 900 XR).\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminum wheels from the S 1000 R model, which weigh around 3.9 lbs. less. The reduced rotational mass is reflected in improved acceleration, braking and handling. The wheel dimensions are 3.5 x 17″ front and 5.5 x 17″ rear with 120/70 ZR 17 and 180/55 ZR 17 tires.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the F 900 R and F 900 XR is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers more safety when braking in corners by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles. ABS Pro prevents the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly and reduces abrupt changes in steering force and thus the bike from returning to the upright position, even during sudden braking. The benefits are increased braking and riding stability combined with the best possible deceleration even when cornering.\n\nABS Pro is designed for road use, with medium to low friction values and optimum braking stability in the Rain and Road riding modes. Regulation takes place at an early stage. In Dynamic mode, ABS Pro assumes that the road surface has very high grip and has a high coefficient of friction. Accordingly, ABS Pro is designed for optimum deceleration, control is late and rear wheel lift detection is reduced.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration. As soon as the sensor cluster supplies a certain deceleration value during braking, any simultaneous desire to accelerate on the part of the rider is detected as implausible and throttle valve opening is suppressed. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance.\n\nElectronics\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 1.7 lbs. lighter. The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights. In keeping with the “all in one” concept, the short, lightweight number plate holder and the rear turn indicator and number plate lights form a single unit, while the brake and taillight functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights.\n\nThe new F 900 XR features Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight as standard. Other new standard features include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and heated grips.\n\nThe adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro, offers more safety when riding at night. This adds additional LED modules which allow for better illumination of the road in bends, ensuring a safer night-time ride. The adaptive headlight, which is unique in these two motorcycle classes, works by activating these additional LED elements in the main headlights, which are equipped with their own reflectors, depending on the lean angle. The adaptive headlight turns on when the motorcycle leans by more than 10 degrees and is travelling at a speed of more than 6 mph. The additional lighting effect functions optimally up to a lean angle of approx. 25°.\n\nThe F 900 XR has distinctive LED light guides to the left and right of the lower headlamp edge, indicating that it is part of the BMW Motorrad XR family.\n\nErgonomics and Design.\n\n“We have made the riding position on the new F 900 R even more sporty and dynamic with an optimized ergonomic triangle. The new F 900 XR benefits from optimized front fairing aerodynamics, which is reflected in a significant reduction in helmet shake.”\n\nDominik Menzel, Product Manager\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. The handlebars are positioned further forwards than on the previous model. A sportier, front-leaning riding position has been achieved by moving the footrests further back and optimizing the foot control positions.\n\nThe new F 900 XR offers more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimized aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet buffeting and even greater riding comfort.\n\nThe hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather. The new F 900 XR can also be fitted with a new, optional 1.18-inch higher windscreen.\n\nStandard and Optional Equipment\n\nLike all 2025 model year BMW motorcycle models, the new F 900 R and F 900 XR include the Ultimate Care Break-In Service, or “600 Mile Service” as standard. This included service further provides BMW customers with a truly premium experience. Time and mileage limits apply – maximum 6 months from the in-service date or maximum 750 miles – whichever comes first.',

        'content': 'Triumph has unveiled its revamped Tiger Sport 660, sprinkling in enough upgrades to keep it sharp and seductive. From a clever inertial measurement unit to a bi-directional quick-shifter, this middleweight tourer is all set to make every ride smoother, safer, and—let’s be honest—cooler.\n\nSharper Safety Tech\n\nThe big headline here is the addition of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Fancy name, but what it does is dead clever: it brings cornering smarts to the traction control and ABS. Think of it as a guardian angel that steps in when the tyres scream for mercy—keeping you upright whether you’re hammering the brakes mid-lean or cracking open the throttle on a wet apex.\n\nEffortless Riding Experience\n\nThe bi-directional quick-shifter reminds you to forget the clutch, just flick through the gears and enjoy the ride. And there’s more wizardry on offer. Triumph’s connectivity system now comes as standard, letting you pair your phone via Bluetooth to keep an eye on calls, texts, and even navigation—all beamed onto a slick TFT screen.\n\nWith two new colours—Roulette Green and Crystal White—it’s like dressing the same sharp suit in a pair of trendy new ties. Simple but effective.\n\nPerformance That Delivers\n\nUnder the skin, the Tiger’s heart remains unchanged—and why fix what isn’t broken? The 660cc inline-three-cylinder engine churns out 80bhp at 10,250rpm and 6.5kgm of torque at 6,250rpm. Translation? It’s butter-smooth when you’re pottering through town, with a growl and punch that’s ready to pounce when the open road calls. Whether it’s city streets or alpine twists, the Tiger delivers with effortless charm.',

        'content': "When Ford announced this week that it was cutting 800 jobs in the UK, the US carmaker also had stern words for the government. It has joined in a chorus of criticism of rules that force car companies to sell more electric vehicles each year. The rules, known as the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, are simply “unworkable”, Ford said.\n\nSomeone should have told Ford back in 2022, when the carmaker strongly backed the policy. In fact, it went further, calling for the British government to force carmakers to sell even more electric cars each year.\n\n“Ford believes that figures lower than Department for Transport’s current proposed trajectory will not send a strong enough signal to customers, manufacturers and investors to spur the appropriate transition,” it said at the time. “Furthermore, any lowering of targets will send the wrong signal in terms of charging infrastructure rollout.”\n\nThe carmaker did argue that the policy should be subject to review if industry conditions change, according to the government consultation response obtained by the Fast Charge newsletter. But the dramatic shift in its position nevertheless illustrates how the industry has been caught out by the slowing growth in demand for electric cars.\n\nDuring the chaos of the coronavirus pandemic – with interest rates at rock bottom – carmakers found that they could sell all the cars they could make (albeit amid problems in getting parts). That has changed now. Carmakers are not experiencing the expected demand for electric cars, with a resurgence instead in sales of hybrids that combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery.\n\nDemand for electric cars has been hit by concerns over public charger numbers, as well as a political backlash (veering into full-on culture war) from critics of net zero carbon policies who argue they are too expensive. Battery cars remain more expensive upfront (even if much cheaper in the long run) despite manufacturers being forced into steep discounts that they argue are unsustainable.\n\nThe carmakers have launched a rearguard lobbying effort to persuade the UK government to relax the mandate, but now find themselves pitted against car charger companies, fleet owners and environmental campaigners who argue that climate targets and billions of pounds of investments will be under threat if the UK government backtracks.\n\nUnder the mandate, electric cars must make up 22% of sales of new vehicles this year, rising to 28% in 2025 – albeit with important loopholes that can reduce the target considerably. If they miss their targets, carmakers face fines of up to £15,000 for each vehicle. No carmakers publicly argue with the goal of 80% battery electric cars by 2030, before a complete ban on new petrol and diesel engines in 2035.\n\nThe mandate is sure to be a key focus for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) when the lobby group’s members convene on Tuesday evening at its annual black tie dinner. Executives at a hotel on Park Lane in London will expect to be ribbed by the host, comedian and TV presenter Tom Allen.\n\nFor the industry, the ZEV mandate is no laughing matter. After months of requests, on Wednesday several carmakers met the transport secretary, Louise Haigh, and business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, in London to plead for more leeway.\n\nView image in fullscreen In 2022, Ford called for a higher rate of electric car sales under the ZEV mandate, as this screenshot of its consultation response shows. It has since changed course. Photograph: Ford; Department for Transport; The Fast Charge\n\nThe Japanese manufacturer Nissan, which runs the UK’s largest car factory at Sunderland, said the mandate was threatening “the viability of thousands of jobs and billions of pounds in investment” – even if industry insiders think it unrealistic that the company would really abandon the plant. Stellantis, the owner of the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citroën brands, claimed in the summer that it could close van plants in Ellesmere Port and Luton because of the mandate.\n\nYet carmakers are not the only group claiming that billions of pounds are on the line. Companies are racing to install the chargers that electric cars require.\n\nVicky Read, the chief executive of Charge UK, a lobby group, was also in the room with ministers. She said there is £6bn of lined-up investment predicated on the ZEV mandate. Flip-flopping – as with Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak’s decision to delay the ban on new petrol cars by five years – damages investment, she said.\n\n“We must not make the same mistake again,” she said. “Anything that leads to fewer fully electric vehicles on UK roads is a no-go for us because it means fewer customers.”\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The headline target is 22% of electric car sales, but in reality they can earn “credits” that lower it. Those credits include lowering the average emissions of their new petrol cars, and “borrowing” excess electric cars made in later years. Another option is buying credits from other brands (although the British industry bristles at the thought of subsidising rivals such as China’s BYD or the US’s Tesla).\n\nWith all the loopholes, the thinktank New AutoMotive has calculated that the real target for 2022 is 18.1% – right in line with the 18.1% electric sales achieved in the first 10 months of 2024. The SMMT disputes those calculations, pointing to disparities between its sales figures and the thinktank’s, although it has not come up with an estimate.\n\nBen Nelmes, the New AutoMotive chief executive, said there is “a high level of uncertainty, and the target could reduce more, or less, depending on the decisions taken by the manufacturers”. Nevertheless, he said that if current trends are maintained it is realistic to think the real target for 2025 could be between 24% and 25% – rather than the headline of 28%.\n\nCarmakers are now arguing for more of those handy “flexibilities”. Ideas presented to ministers this week included allowing carmakers to comply if they overachieve on targets in later years, and giving extra credits to electric cars made in Britain – a policy that could be attractive given the political importance of maintaining UK jobs.\n\nThe business department is thought to be open to relaxing the rules, but industry has so far found the transport department less responsive to its entreaties as it keeps its eye on climate goals.\n\nColin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, a campaign group, argued that the mandate is working and is good for British consumers.\n\n“The mandate is incentivising manufacturers to compete on price, and as prices come down, sales are going up, with more than one in five new cars sold in the UK being an EV in the last three months,” he said.\n\nWhatever happens, the industry is unlikely to let up the pressure on the government, given jobs cuts, falling profits, and steep investment needs around the world. It is likely that some of them will face fines with the rules as they are.\n\nDavid Bailey, the professor of business economics at the University of Birmingham, said he believed that more flexibilities are warranted. “The ramp-up is really quite severe,” he said. “I think companies will struggle to hit that.”",

        'content': 'The Kia EV6 GT is about to receive even more power – and will also get one of the more novel features from the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.\n\nAlready the most powerful car in Kia’s line-up, the EV6 GT currently produces 577bhp and 740Nm of torque from its dual-motor powertrain. However, as part of a mid-life refresh, the maximum power output has jumped to 641bhp and 770Nm of torque when ‘GT’ mode is activated. During everyday driving, there will be 601bhp on tap, and the same 740Nm as before.\n\nAdvertisement - Article continues below\n\nAccordingly, performance is likely to be improved. 0-62mph takes just 3.5 seconds in the outgoing EV6 GT, and while Kia has not yet confirmed a figure for the upgraded model, we expect that extra power will have shaved at least a tenth of a second off the already impressive sprint time.\n\nThat would enable it to at least match the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N’s 3.4-second 0-62mph sprint, and come close to the Tesla Model 3 Performance’s time of roughly three seconds.\n\nThe only other detail Kia has confirmed so far is that the EV6 GT will get a new ‘Virtual Gear Shift’ feature, just like the Ioniq 5 N. It’s designed to create a more engaging driving experience by adjusting the car’s torque output to deliver a small jolt and create the impression of a gear change when you pull on the paddles on the steering wheel.',

J. Bendall Ltd in Hitchin in February 1967 at a cost of £750.00.\n\n'The original purchase receipt and cheque remains with a photograph of the late owner and his wife standing proudly beside their new purchase.\n\n'We understand from the late owner's family that the cars were last running in the 1980s and have remained preserved in his barn for the last four decades.'\n\nThe discovery of the hidden jewels comes shortly after a hoard of classic cars were found in a rural warehouse in Wales - worth an estimated £1 million.\n\nThe motor graveyard, which was packed out with iconic yet rusting cars such as Bentleys, Jaguars, a Porsche and even a Rolls-Royce, were found earlier this year.\n\nBut the epic treasure trove had seen better days, with many cars drowned in a veil of dust and rust, while others were missing doors and had plants growing through their mechanisms.\n\nHowever urban explorer, Daniel Sims, who refused to disclose the location of where he found the cars, believed their historic and sentimental value was upwards of £1million.\n\nThe 35-year-old, divulged there must have been more than 100 vehicles hidden away in the building, which he has documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality.\n\nHe said: 'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself.\n\nA motor graveyard filled with Rolls Royce, Jaguar and Porsche cars have been found withering away in a warehouse in Wales\n\nThe collection - worth up to a staggering £1 million - is every car enthusiasts dream\n\nHowever many of the antique cars have seen better days with many hidden away behind plants, or gathering dust as they rot away in the warehouse\n\n'I don't know anything about the history of the place other than whoever has been collecting these cars for decades and has an impressive collection which they must be proud of.\n\n'The cars were visible from the roadside so once on a field it was open access as the back of the property fence had fallen down.\n\n'We were quite nervous as we didn't know the backstory of this place apart from it containing a car graveyard with classic cars and from what we saw must have been over 100 hidden away here.\n\n'The place itself is a little overgrown at the back with rust and decay setting into the vehicles. Some were stored away meaning the damage to these amazing vehicles was minimal which is crazy to see.\n\n'Iconic cars such as Bentleys, Porsche, Peugeot 205 GTI , various Mercedes, MGs and quite a few imports from different countries are hidden here and would be worth a minimum from what I saw over £500,000 to £1,000,000 just off basic calculations.'\n\nOther vehicles found inside include Land Rover Defenders, Jaguars, Morris Minor 1100, a Rolls-Royce, MG MGA 1960, Mercedes-Benz, Triumph, Jaguar MK1, Mini Coopers, MG MG B, Cadillac Eldorado and a Volkswagen caddy.\n\n'I love taking photos of different things and items and dramatic places such as this and showing how these places and items end up,' Mr Sims added.\n\n'For a lot of people, these iconic cars will hold a lot of memories.\n\nUrban explorer Daniel Sims, made the astonishing find but is refusing to reveal the location of the warehouse for fear of attracting looters\n\nHehas documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality - and is under the impression the loot could be worth around £1million\n\nSeveral Mercedes, MGs, MG Midgets, Land Rover Discoveries, Volkswagens were found among the rusting vehicles\n\n'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself,' Mr Sims said\n\n'There were no scary moments but we were interrupted towards the end of the exploration by some locals who were worried we could be burglars as there had been some rural crime taking place in the area recently.\n\n'We explained how we were photographers and moved on from the area.\n\n'Just the sheer amount of vehicles collected which is rare to see and was a real treat to see so many iconic cars collected here.'\n\nHowever it isn't the first time urban explorers have discovered a treasure trove of vehicles, as two upon this car graveyard that is filled with hundreds of classic motors last year.\n\nMatt, 43, from Sheffield, and Andy, 56, from Doncaster - both YouTubers - journeyed to the secretive location in Suffolk.\n\nThey originally wanted to explore an abandoned house, but ended up stumbling across a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nThe pair documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel, FindersBeepers, where they showcased the goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and reclaimed by the earth.\n\nMatt said: 'After doing a lot of research on Google Earth, Andy came across the typical signs of an abandoned house only to go on to find a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nHoards of clutter filling one side of the barn which is packed with antique cars\n\nA micro car next to a Fiat Coupe, both of which have been left rotting away among the hidden collection located somewhere in Wales\n\nSeveral cars estimated to be worth thousands lined up rusting away in unison, hidden from public view\n\nA picture of the barn where the vehicles are held from the exterior\n\n'We were desperate to document them before they were lost to decay.\n\n'The nostalgia around old cars is huge and our viewers loved that seeing some of the classics brought back strong memories from their childhood. That's one of the main reasons why we make our videos.\n\n'I was a massive fan of the Jowett Javelin, however, Andy favoured the Ford Prefect. There are hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cars in that place even if it was for parts on some of them.\n\n'There were around 100 cars across the property,' he added.\n\n'It's hard to know the backstory of all the abandoned places we go. We mostly research as we go but on this occasion, there was very little to find out.'\n\nIn 2022, an urban explorer discovered a mystery classic car collection just thirty miles from Edinburgh, Scotland - as sixty year old cars were being left to rust.\n\nJaguars and Austins accounted for the majority of vehicles at this location which may be concealing some rare, hidden gems.\n\nIt's believed that the classic motors were collected by an unknown Jaguar enthusiast.\n\nSome of those vehicles dating back to the sixties and were in a sorry state. However, back in the day, the motors were highly sought after.\n\nAt the time, Jaguars were very fashionable, seen gracing the tracks at the infamous Le Mans race, and cost up to £45,000 in today's currency value.\n\nFinders Beepers' Matt Nadin and Andy Thompson exploring the car graveyard with over a hundred classic cars in 2023\n\nThe duo found a car graveyard filled with hundreds of classic motors that time has forgotten\n\nMany of the vehicles were stored carefully in a garage, with dozens of others outside\n\nAn old Bentley S2 was among the litany of rusted vehicles left outside the property\n\nThe rusted front grill of a classic automobile outside the abandoned house in Suffolk\n\nOutside the barn was a field which was also rammed with classic vehicles\n\nFindersBeepers showcased the goldmine of old classic cars on their Youtube channel\n\nMany of the vehicles would be worth tens of thousands of pounds\n\nFinders Beepers documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel\n\nThe goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and were left dormant in the field\n\nIn 2016, a mountain of abandoned cars from the 1970s were found 200ft below ground in an abandoned slate mine.\n\nUp to 100 cars in various condition were discovered cascading down the inside of the cave in Ceredigion, Wales.\n\nUrban explorers made a treacherous journey through darkness, in dangerous conditions and were stunned to find a car graveyard at the mine, which closed in 1960.\n\nIT Engineer Gregory Rivolet, 31, spent four hours exploring this unlikely last resting place for abandoned vehicles.\n\n'It was very dangerous as the mine is really unstable. Pieces of slate were falling from above our heads,' he said.\n\n'We had to use rope to climb down to the right level of the mine, the descent was around sixty-five feet deep, it didn't feel very secure at all.'",

        'content': 'BMW Motorrad USA proudly presents the updated 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR. The new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR benefit from technical and visual upgrades as well as from significantly extended standard equipment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad takes its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new F 900 R focuses on sporty riding, the F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on both windy roads and on longer tours with luggage.\n\n“With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 6.6 lbs., we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the F 900 XR from optimized aerodynamics.”\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nEngine and Drivetrain\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR are even more dynamic and safer thanks to the new “Dynamic” riding mode and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), now standard.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested 895 cc two-cylinder in-line engine produces 105 hp and 68.6 lb-ft over a wide torque curve, while meeting current Euro 5+ homologation standards. With a 270/450 degree firing interval, the engine generates a very emotional exhaust note. The new sports silencer, available as a genuine BMW Motorrad Accessory in collaboration with Akrapovič, provides an even more expressive exhaust sound.\n\nThe F 900 R and F 900 XR are offered with two standard riding modes, Rain and Road. The optional Dynamic riding mode has received new settings. It has a throttle response curve that is more direct, making it ideal for sporty riding. Dynamic Traction Control DTC, which ensures a high level of riding safety, is also a new standard feature on both models. It contributes significantly to the high riding dynamics and exemplary riding safety. DTC provides valuable support and a significant safety advantage, especially in changing riding conditions, on surfaces with less grip and surfaces with changing friction.\n\nThe engine control unit detects a spinning rear wheel by comparing the speeds of the front and rear wheels via the ABS sensors with data from the lean angle sensor box. In this case, it reduces drive torque within milliseconds by reducing the ignition timing, intervening in the fuel injection system, and influencing the throttle position.\n\nDTC also uses a sensor cluster to measure the lean angle and takes this into account in its control behavior. DTC works with the different riding modes to ensure maximum riding safety.\n\nDTC provides valuable assistance and an enormous safety advantage when accelerating. However, it cannot redefine the physical limits of riding. It is still possible to exceed these limits through misjudgment or riding errors. However, DTC helps to make the most of the bike’s dynamic capabilities in a much safer manner. The DTC can be switched off separately for special requirements, such as riding on the track.\n\nIn addition to the anti-hopping clutch, the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR now feature standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control. This system prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nChassis and Suspension\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down 43 mm telescopic forks. In contrast to the previous models, the rebound, compression and spring preload are all adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements, operating conditions, and load conditions. Suspension travel is 5.3 inches (F 900 R) and 6.7 inches (F 900 XR).\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminum wheels from the S 1000 R model, which weigh around 3.9 lbs. less. The reduced rotational mass is reflected in improved acceleration, braking and handling. The wheel dimensions are 3.5 x 17″ front and 5.5 x 17″ rear with 120/70 ZR 17 and 180/55 ZR 17 tires.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the F 900 R and F 900 XR is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers more safety when braking in corners by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles. ABS Pro prevents the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly and reduces abrupt changes in steering force and thus the bike from returning to the upright position, even during sudden braking. The benefits are increased braking and riding stability combined with the best possible deceleration even when cornering.\n\nABS Pro is designed for road use, with medium to low friction values and optimum braking stability in the Rain and Road riding modes. Regulation takes place at an early stage. In Dynamic mode, ABS Pro assumes that the road surface has very high grip and has a high coefficient of friction. Accordingly, ABS Pro is designed for optimum deceleration, control is late and rear wheel lift detection is reduced.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration. As soon as the sensor cluster supplies a certain deceleration value during braking, any simultaneous desire to accelerate on the part of the rider is detected as implausible and throttle valve opening is suppressed. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance.\n\nElectronics\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 1.7 lbs. lighter. The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights. In keeping with the “all in one” concept, the short, lightweight number plate holder and the rear turn indicator and number plate lights form a single unit, while the brake and taillight functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights.\n\nThe new F 900 XR features Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight as standard. Other new standard features include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and heated grips.\n\nThe adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro, offers more safety when riding at night. This adds additional LED modules which allow for better illumination of the road in bends, ensuring a safer night-time ride. The adaptive headlight, which is unique in these two motorcycle classes, works by activating these additional LED elements in the main headlights, which are equipped with their own reflectors, depending on the lean angle. The adaptive headlight turns on when the motorcycle leans by more than 10 degrees and is travelling at a speed of more than 6 mph. The additional lighting effect functions optimally up to a lean angle of approx. 25°.\n\nThe F 900 XR has distinctive LED light guides to the left and right of the lower headlamp edge, indicating that it is part of the BMW Motorrad XR family.\n\nErgonomics and Design.\n\n“We have made the riding position on the new F 900 R even more sporty and dynamic with an optimized ergonomic triangle. The new F 900 XR benefits from optimized front fairing aerodynamics, which is reflected in a significant reduction in helmet shake.”\n\nDominik Menzel, Product Manager\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. The handlebars are positioned further forwards than on the previous model. A sportier, front-leaning riding position has been achieved by moving the footrests further back and optimizing the foot control positions.\n\nThe new F 900 XR offers more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimized aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet buffeting and even greater riding comfort.\n\nThe hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather. The new F 900 XR can also be fitted with a new, optional 1.18-inch higher windscreen.\n\nStandard and Optional Equipment\n\nLike all 2025 model year BMW motorcycle models, the new F 900 R and F 900 XR include the Ultimate Care Break-In Service, or “600 Mile Service” as standard. This included service further provides BMW customers with a truly premium experience. Time and mileage limits apply – maximum 6 months from the in-service date or maximum 750 miles – whichever comes first.',

        'content': 'Triumph has unveiled its revamped Tiger Sport 660, sprinkling in enough upgrades to keep it sharp and seductive. From a clever inertial measurement unit to a bi-directional quick-shifter, this middleweight tourer is all set to make every ride smoother, safer, and—let’s be honest—cooler.\n\nSharper Safety Tech\n\nThe big headline here is the addition of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Fancy name, but what it does is dead clever: it brings cornering smarts to the traction control and ABS. Think of it as a guardian angel that steps in when the tyres scream for mercy—keeping you upright whether you’re hammering the brakes mid-lean or cracking open the throttle on a wet apex.\n\nEffortless Riding Experience\n\nThe bi-directional quick-shifter reminds you to forget the clutch, just flick through the gears and enjoy the ride. And there’s more wizardry on offer. Triumph’s connectivity system now comes as standard, letting you pair your phone via Bluetooth to keep an eye on calls, texts, and even navigation—all beamed onto a slick TFT screen.\n\nWith two new colours—Roulette Green and Crystal White—it’s like dressing the same sharp suit in a pair of trendy new ties. Simple but effective.\n\nPerformance That Delivers\n\nUnder the skin, the Tiger’s heart remains unchanged—and why fix what isn’t broken? The 660cc inline-three-cylinder engine churns out 80bhp at 10,250rpm and 6.5kgm of torque at 6,250rpm. Translation? It’s butter-smooth when you’re pottering through town, with a growl and punch that’s ready to pounce when the open road calls. Whether it’s city streets or alpine twists, the Tiger delivers with effortless charm.',

        'content': 'Electric vehicle breakdowns due to running out of charge have hit their lowest ever level in the UK, dropping to less than two per cent, according to a new report.\n\nThe figures, revealed at the Transport + Energy Forum at Warwick University, show that out-of-charge incidents now account for just 1.85 per cent of EV-related breakdowns.\n\nThis marks a significant improvement from 2023, when the rolling 12-month figure stood at 2.26 per cent. The AA attributed this decline to several factors, including new battery technology, better range, improved charging performance and reliability, charge post support and enhanced driver and dealer knowledge. Do you have a story you\'d like to share? Get in touch by emailingmotoring@gbnews.uk\n\nAA urged drivers to switch to electric vehicles PA\n\nThe trend mirrors similar patterns seen in Norway, which has Europe\'s highest EV adoption rate. The decline in out-of-charge breakdowns represents a dramatic shift from 2015, when 8.26 per cent of EV breakdowns were due to depleted batteries. Data from the AA shows a consistent downward trend over the past decade, with only minor increases recorded in 2017 and 2019. The proportion dropped from 7.12 per cent in 2016 to 6.83 per cent in 2018, before falling more sharply to 4.89 per cent in 2020. Recent years have seen even more substantial improvements, with figures declining to 4.28 per cent in 2021 and 3.72 per cent in 2022.\n\nThe AA expects these numbers to eventually match those of conventional vehicles, with a target of around one per cent - similar to the proportion of petrol and diesel cars running out of fuel. This 80 per cent reduction in out-of-charge incidents over eight years demonstrates significant progress in EV reliability and infrastructure. The AA handles approximately 8,000 breakdowns across all vehicle categories each day, with only five or six cases involving out-of-charge electric vehicles. Many of these cases aren\'t completely depleted vehicles, but rather those low on charge or experiencing technical difficulties in reaching the next charging point.\n\nThe breakdown service has found that the top 30 per cent of EV faults mirror those of conventional vehicles, primarily involving tyres, wheels and the 12V battery. This data suggests that EVs are becoming increasingly reliable, with charging-related issues representing only a small fraction of overall breakdowns. The similarity in common faults between EVs and traditional vehicles indicates that electric cars are experiencing many of the same routine maintenance issues as their petrol and diesel counterparts. Edmund King, AA president, said: "The AA\'s latest figures show that less than two per cent of EV breakdowns are for out of charge which suggests range anxiety should be a thing of the past. "Many of the out of charge breakdowns aren\'t on zero charge but are either low on charge or experiencing technical problems such as the vehicle charge point covers sticking.” LATEST DEVELOPMENTS: WATCH NOW: Footage reveals drivers endangering British bin workers - ‘Simply unacceptable’\n\nDrivers warned of rise in car thefts over Christmas period with millions at risk\n\nStorm Bert causes major A-roads and motorways to delay as winds reach 70mph - \'It\'s dangerous!\'\n\nEVs only account for less than two per cent of all breakdowns covered by AA PA',

But on Thursday night, at a court in New York, Northvolt’s lawyers filed for bankruptcy protection amid a cash crisis for the European battery champion.\n\nDespite raising more than $15bn (£12bn) from investors, bondholders, pension funds and European governments since it was founded in 2016, this week the company had less than one week’s cash remaining – $30m.\n\nNorthvolt has blamed its downfall on foundering demand for electric vehicles (EVs) across Europe. Its “capital structure and business plan were premised on the assumption that the electric vehicle industry would continue its pattern of consistent growth”, said Scott Millar, a restructuring adviser at Teneo, in the company’s court pleading.\n\nAs investor fervour for EVs reached its peak during the pandemic, Northvolt expanded aggressively across Europe, the United States and Canada, with plans for a network of gigafactories, as the facilities that manufacture car batteries are known.\n\nHowever, the bottom fell out of the global market for battery-powered cars in 2023 as inflation and hesitant consumer demand led to a slowdown – and in some cases slump – in EV sales.\n\nAnalysts at Rho Motion pared back their predictions for EV sales by a quarter, to 8.3m by 2030. In Europe, home to Northvolt’s biggest clients, demand has been particularly weak. Sales are down 3pc so far this year, according to Rho Motion. In Germany, they have fallen by 18pc.',

        'content': 'It comes as the RAC expressed concerns certain communities are missing out, with the figures showing an inconsistent supply of chargers across the UK.\n\nDepartment for Transport figures show there were 179 public electric car chargers in Dudley as of July – down from 198 the year before.\n\nIt means the number of public chargers has fallen by - 10 per cent over the last year.\n\nThe Government set a target of installing 300,000 public electric chargers by 2030, meaning around 3,600 chargers must be installed across the UK per month.\n\nOf the chargers installed in Dudley, 69 were rapid chargers.\n\nNationally, 65,000 chargers had been installed as of July – a rise of 47 per cent on the year before. It means the Government is on track to meet its 2030 target.\n\nBut the RAC said areas currently poorly served need to be prioritised, with some places having more than 1,000 chargers per 100,000 people and others having fewer than 30 per 100,000.\n\nThere were 55 public chargers per 100,000 people in Dudley.\n\nMeanwhile, just two of the 14 local authorities with the best access were based outside of London, while the capital accounted for nearly a third of the chargers nationally.\n\nRAC head of policy Simon Williams said: "It is extremely positive that electric vehicle chargers continue to be installed at pace in public locations, giving current and prospective EV drivers more confidence that they’ll be able to charge up when and where they need to, but there are significant differences when it comes to regional and local accessibility."\n\nHe said London benefits from on-street bollard and lamppost chargers which are "non-existent in many other parts of the country", and warned rapid chargers – which drivers travelling beyond their range or without access to a home charger rely on – are more available in Scotland, the South West and the Midlands than the capital.\n\n"Everything is moving in the right direction, but it’s still the case that building the charging infrastructure the UK needs is no mean feat," he added.\n\n"Private charging networks and local authorities need to carefully assess current and future demand for chargers, while at the same relying on the companies that run the electricity grid to get the cabling where it needs to be. Installing chargers in those parts of the UK that are currently poorly served should be a priority."\n\nA DfT spokesperson said: "We are committed to accelerating the rollout of charge-points across the UK.\n\n"And we want to go further and faster right across the country, giving drivers the confidence to make the move to zero-emission vehicles."',

J. Bendall Ltd in Hitchin in February 1967 at a cost of £750.00.\n\n'The original purchase receipt and cheque remains with a photograph of the late owner and his wife standing proudly beside their new purchase.\n\n'We understand from the late owner's family that the cars were last running in the 1980s and have remained preserved in his barn for the last four decades.'\n\nThe discovery of the hidden jewels comes shortly after a hoard of classic cars were found in a rural warehouse in Wales - worth an estimated £1 million.\n\nThe motor graveyard, which was packed out with iconic yet rusting cars such as Bentleys, Jaguars, a Porsche and even a Rolls-Royce, were found earlier this year.\n\nBut the epic treasure trove had seen better days, with many cars drowned in a veil of dust and rust, while others were missing doors and had plants growing through their mechanisms.\n\nHowever urban explorer, Daniel Sims, who refused to disclose the location of where he found the cars, believed their historic and sentimental value was upwards of £1million.\n\nThe 35-year-old, divulged there must have been more than 100 vehicles hidden away in the building, which he has documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality.\n\nHe said: 'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself.\n\nA motor graveyard filled with Rolls Royce, Jaguar and Porsche cars have been found withering away in a warehouse in Wales\n\nThe collection - worth up to a staggering £1 million - is every car enthusiasts dream\n\nHowever many of the antique cars have seen better days with many hidden away behind plants, or gathering dust as they rot away in the warehouse\n\n'I don't know anything about the history of the place other than whoever has been collecting these cars for decades and has an impressive collection which they must be proud of.\n\n'The cars were visible from the roadside so once on a field it was open access as the back of the property fence had fallen down.\n\n'We were quite nervous as we didn't know the backstory of this place apart from it containing a car graveyard with classic cars and from what we saw must have been over 100 hidden away here.\n\n'The place itself is a little overgrown at the back with rust and decay setting into the vehicles. Some were stored away meaning the damage to these amazing vehicles was minimal which is crazy to see.\n\n'Iconic cars such as Bentleys, Porsche, Peugeot 205 GTI , various Mercedes, MGs and quite a few imports from different countries are hidden here and would be worth a minimum from what I saw over £500,000 to £1,000,000 just off basic calculations.'\n\nOther vehicles found inside include Land Rover Defenders, Jaguars, Morris Minor 1100, a Rolls-Royce, MG MGA 1960, Mercedes-Benz, Triumph, Jaguar MK1, Mini Coopers, MG MG B, Cadillac Eldorado and a Volkswagen caddy.\n\n'I love taking photos of different things and items and dramatic places such as this and showing how these places and items end up,' Mr Sims added.\n\n'For a lot of people, these iconic cars will hold a lot of memories.\n\nUrban explorer Daniel Sims, made the astonishing find but is refusing to reveal the location of the warehouse for fear of attracting looters\n\nHehas documented for his YouTube channel Bearded Reality - and is under the impression the loot could be worth around £1million\n\nSeveral Mercedes, MGs, MG Midgets, Land Rover Discoveries, Volkswagens were found among the rusting vehicles\n\n'I was tipped off about a potential massive car graveyard by another explorer so I decided to check it out for myself,' Mr Sims said\n\n'There were no scary moments but we were interrupted towards the end of the exploration by some locals who were worried we could be burglars as there had been some rural crime taking place in the area recently.\n\n'We explained how we were photographers and moved on from the area.\n\n'Just the sheer amount of vehicles collected which is rare to see and was a real treat to see so many iconic cars collected here.'\n\nHowever it isn't the first time urban explorers have discovered a treasure trove of vehicles, as two upon this car graveyard that is filled with hundreds of classic motors last year.\n\nMatt, 43, from Sheffield, and Andy, 56, from Doncaster - both YouTubers - journeyed to the secretive location in Suffolk.\n\nThey originally wanted to explore an abandoned house, but ended up stumbling across a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nThe pair documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel, FindersBeepers, where they showcased the goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and reclaimed by the earth.\n\nMatt said: 'After doing a lot of research on Google Earth, Andy came across the typical signs of an abandoned house only to go on to find a huge barn and field full of classic cars.\n\nHoards of clutter filling one side of the barn which is packed with antique cars\n\nA micro car next to a Fiat Coupe, both of which have been left rotting away among the hidden collection located somewhere in Wales\n\nSeveral cars estimated to be worth thousands lined up rusting away in unison, hidden from public view\n\nA picture of the barn where the vehicles are held from the exterior\n\n'We were desperate to document them before they were lost to decay.\n\n'The nostalgia around old cars is huge and our viewers loved that seeing some of the classics brought back strong memories from their childhood. That's one of the main reasons why we make our videos.\n\n'I was a massive fan of the Jowett Javelin, however, Andy favoured the Ford Prefect. There are hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of cars in that place even if it was for parts on some of them.\n\n'There were around 100 cars across the property,' he added.\n\n'It's hard to know the backstory of all the abandoned places we go. We mostly research as we go but on this occasion, there was very little to find out.'\n\nIn 2022, an urban explorer discovered a mystery classic car collection just thirty miles from Edinburgh, Scotland - as sixty year old cars were being left to rust.\n\nJaguars and Austins accounted for the majority of vehicles at this location which may be concealing some rare, hidden gems.\n\nIt's believed that the classic motors were collected by an unknown Jaguar enthusiast.\n\nSome of those vehicles dating back to the sixties and were in a sorry state. However, back in the day, the motors were highly sought after.\n\nAt the time, Jaguars were very fashionable, seen gracing the tracks at the infamous Le Mans race, and cost up to £45,000 in today's currency value.\n\nFinders Beepers' Matt Nadin and Andy Thompson exploring the car graveyard with over a hundred classic cars in 2023\n\nThe duo found a car graveyard filled with hundreds of classic motors that time has forgotten\n\nMany of the vehicles were stored carefully in a garage, with dozens of others outside\n\nAn old Bentley S2 was among the litany of rusted vehicles left outside the property\n\nThe rusted front grill of a classic automobile outside the abandoned house in Suffolk\n\nOutside the barn was a field which was also rammed with classic vehicles\n\nFindersBeepers showcased the goldmine of old classic cars on their Youtube channel\n\nMany of the vehicles would be worth tens of thousands of pounds\n\nFinders Beepers documented their incredible findings on their YouTube channel\n\nThe goldmine of old classic cars that have been abandoned and were left dormant in the field\n\nIn 2016, a mountain of abandoned cars from the 1970s were found 200ft below ground in an abandoned slate mine.\n\nUp to 100 cars in various condition were discovered cascading down the inside of the cave in Ceredigion, Wales.\n\nUrban explorers made a treacherous journey through darkness, in dangerous conditions and were stunned to find a car graveyard at the mine, which closed in 1960.\n\nIT Engineer Gregory Rivolet, 31, spent four hours exploring this unlikely last resting place for abandoned vehicles.\n\n'It was very dangerous as the mine is really unstable. Pieces of slate were falling from above our heads,' he said.\n\n'We had to use rope to climb down to the right level of the mine, the descent was around sixty-five feet deep, it didn't feel very secure at all.'",

        'content': '"With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 3 kilograms, we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new BMW F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the BMW F 900 XR from optimised aerodynamics."\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR: Technical and visual upgrades and significantly extended standard equipment for the dynamic roadster and long-distance sports bike in the mid-range segment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new BMW F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad is taking its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun in twisty terrain, with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new BMW F 900 R as a Dynamic Roadster focuses primarily on sporty riding pleasure, the BMW F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on longer tours and holiday trips with luggage.\n\nPowerful two-cylinder in-line engine with Euro 5+ homologation. Dynamic riding mode with sportier set-up, Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) and engine drag torque control now standard. New sports silencer in collaboration with Akrapovič as genuine BMW Motorrad accessories.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested two-cylinder in-line engine with 895 cc capacity and 77 kW (105 bhp) of power output ensures pleasurable riding dynamics. It also delivers a full-bodied torque curve in the current Euro 5+ homologation. With the newly tuned standard "Dynamic" driving mode, the two new F models offer even more riding pleasure and dynamics at a sporty pace. Dynamic Traction Control (DTC) is fitted as standard to ensure the best possible safety during acceleration. The engine drag torque control is also standard. It prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nThe sound of the two-cylinder engine, which already has a powerful character due to the 270/450 degree firing interval, is made even throatier by the new sports silencer available as a genuine BMW Motorrad accessory (in cooperation with Akrapovič), which also offers a weight saving of approximately 1.2 kg.\n\nNew upside-down telescopic forks with adjustable damping rebound and compression damping and spring preload. New wheels, approx. 1.8 kg lighter.\n\nBMW Motorrad ABS Pro and Dynamic Brake Control DBC as standard - for even more safety when braking.\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down telescopic forks with 43 mm slider tube diameter. Both rebound and compression damping as well as spring preload are now adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminium wheels. They weigh around 1.8 kg less than the previous models, contributing to a total weight reduction of 3 kg.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the new F models is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers even more safety when braking in bends by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides even greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration.\n\nNew, 0.8 kg lighter battery as standard and function-integrated turn indicator lights in the new rear end. BMW F 900 XR with Headlight Pro including daytime running light, adaptive headlight, USB-C charging port and heated grips as standard.\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 0.8 kg lighter. They also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights (brake and tail light functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights).\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR comes with Headlight Pro as standard, including daytime running light and adaptive headlight for even greater safety when riding at night. Other new standard features of the BMW F 900 XR include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and the heated grips.\n\nBMW F 900 R with optimised ergonomics thanks to a redefined position of the handlebars and footrests for a more sporty riding position. New headlight side trim painted in body colour.\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle between the handlebars, seat and footrests of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. This has made it possible to create a riding position that is significantly more sporty and closer to the front wheel.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 R\'s increased sporting ambitions are emphasised by the headlamp side trim painted in body colour.\n\nBMW F 900 XR with optimised aerodynamics and hand protectors as standard.\n\nThe new BMW F 900 XR offers even more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimised aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet vibration and even greater riding comfort.

        'content': 'BMW Motorrad USA proudly presents the updated 2025 F 900 R and F 900 XR. The new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR benefit from technical and visual upgrades as well as from significantly extended standard equipment.\n\nWith the new BMW F 900 R dynamic roadster and the new F 900 XR crossover bike, BMW Motorrad takes its popular mid-range product range to a new level. Both F-models are designed for sportiness and fun with even more agile handling and are suitable for experienced riders as well as newcomers and those returning to motorcycling. While the new F 900 R focuses on sporty riding, the F 900 XR has everything it takes to be a confident partner on both windy roads and on longer tours with luggage.\n\n“With a significantly extended range of standard equipment, fully adjustable upside-down forks, lighter wheels and a weight saving of 6.6 lbs., we have been able to make the BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR even more attractive. The new F 900 R also benefits from a sportier riding position and the F 900 XR from optimized aerodynamics.”\n\nAnton Huber, Project Manager\n\nEngine and Drivetrain\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR are even more dynamic and safer thanks to the new “Dynamic” riding mode and Dynamic Traction Control (DTC), now standard.\n\nIn the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR, the tried-and-tested 895 cc two-cylinder in-line engine produces 105 hp and 68.6 lb-ft over a wide torque curve, while meeting current Euro 5+ homologation standards. With a 270/450 degree firing interval, the engine generates a very emotional exhaust note. The new sports silencer, available as a genuine BMW Motorrad Accessory in collaboration with Akrapovič, provides an even more expressive exhaust sound.\n\nThe F 900 R and F 900 XR are offered with two standard riding modes, Rain and Road. The optional Dynamic riding mode has received new settings. It has a throttle response curve that is more direct, making it ideal for sporty riding. Dynamic Traction Control DTC, which ensures a high level of riding safety, is also a new standard feature on both models. It contributes significantly to the high riding dynamics and exemplary riding safety. DTC provides valuable support and a significant safety advantage, especially in changing riding conditions, on surfaces with less grip and surfaces with changing friction.\n\nThe engine control unit detects a spinning rear wheel by comparing the speeds of the front and rear wheels via the ABS sensors with data from the lean angle sensor box. In this case, it reduces drive torque within milliseconds by reducing the ignition timing, intervening in the fuel injection system, and influencing the throttle position.\n\nDTC also uses a sensor cluster to measure the lean angle and takes this into account in its control behavior. DTC works with the different riding modes to ensure maximum riding safety.\n\nDTC provides valuable assistance and an enormous safety advantage when accelerating. However, it cannot redefine the physical limits of riding. It is still possible to exceed these limits through misjudgment or riding errors. However, DTC helps to make the most of the bike’s dynamic capabilities in a much safer manner. The DTC can be switched off separately for special requirements, such as riding on the track.\n\nIn addition to the anti-hopping clutch, the new BMW F 900 R and F 900 XR now feature standard MSR Engine Drag Torque Control. This system prevents rear wheel spin or skidding caused by abrupt throttle release or downshifting, for an even higher level of safety.\n\nChassis and Suspension\n\nOn both the new BMW F 900 R and the new BMW F 900 XR, the front wheel is guided by new, torsionally rigid, upside-down 43 mm telescopic forks. In contrast to the previous models, the rebound, compression and spring preload are all adjustable. This makes it possible to tailor the forks to suit individual requirements, operating conditions, and load conditions. Suspension travel is 5.3 inches (F 900 R) and 6.7 inches (F 900 XR).\n\nThe new F 900 R and F 900 XR also feature new 17-inch cast aluminum wheels from the S 1000 R model, which weigh around 3.9 lbs. less. The reduced rotational mass is reflected in improved acceleration, braking and handling. The wheel dimensions are 3.5 x 17″ front and 5.5 x 17″ rear with 120/70 ZR 17 and 180/55 ZR 17 tires.\n\nAnother new standard feature on the F 900 R and F 900 XR is BMW Motorrad ABS Pro. In contrast to BMW Motorrad ABS, ABS Pro goes one step further and offers more safety when braking in corners by enabling ABS-assisted braking at lean angles. ABS Pro prevents the wheels from locking even when the brakes are applied quickly and reduces abrupt changes in steering force and thus the bike from returning to the upright position, even during sudden braking. The benefits are increased braking and riding stability combined with the best possible deceleration even when cornering.\n\nABS Pro is designed for road use, with medium to low friction values and optimum braking stability in the Rain and Road riding modes. Regulation takes place at an early stage. In Dynamic mode, ABS Pro assumes that the road surface has very high grip and has a high coefficient of friction. Accordingly, ABS Pro is designed for optimum deceleration, control is late and rear wheel lift detection is reduced.\n\nAnother new standard safety feature is Dynamic Brake Control (DBC), which provides greater safety when braking in difficult situations by preventing unintentional acceleration. As soon as the sensor cluster supplies a certain deceleration value during braking, any simultaneous desire to accelerate on the part of the rider is detected as implausible and throttle valve opening is suppressed. This keeps the motorcycle stable and shortens the braking distance.\n\nElectronics\n\nThe two new F Series models are equipped with a new battery that is 1.7 lbs. lighter. The new F 900 R and F 900 XR also have a new rear end with function-integrated turn indicator lights. In keeping with the “all in one” concept, the short, lightweight number plate holder and the rear turn indicator and number plate lights form a single unit, while the brake and taillight functions are integrated into the turn indicator lights.\n\nThe new F 900 XR features Headlight Pro with adaptive headlight as standard. Other new standard features include the USB-C charging port on the right-hand side of the cockpit with a maximum charging current of 2.4 A and heated grips.\n\nThe adaptive headlight, part of Headlight Pro, offers more safety when riding at night. This adds additional LED modules which allow for better illumination of the road in bends, ensuring a safer night-time ride. The adaptive headlight, which is unique in these two motorcycle classes, works by activating these additional LED elements in the main headlights, which are equipped with their own reflectors, depending on the lean angle. The adaptive headlight turns on when the motorcycle leans by more than 10 degrees and is travelling at a speed of more than 6 mph. The additional lighting effect functions optimally up to a lean angle of approx. 25°.\n\nThe F 900 XR has distinctive LED light guides to the left and right of the lower headlamp edge, indicating that it is part of the BMW Motorrad XR family.\n\nErgonomics and Design.\n\n“We have made the riding position on the new F 900 R even more sporty and dynamic with an optimized ergonomic triangle. The new F 900 XR benefits from optimized front fairing aerodynamics, which is reflected in a significant reduction in helmet shake.”\n\nDominik Menzel, Product Manager\n\nThe handlebars, footrests and foot levers of the ergonomic triangle of the new BMW F 900 R have been redesigned. The handlebars are positioned further forwards than on the previous model. A sportier, front-leaning riding position has been achieved by moving the footrests further back and optimizing the foot control positions.\n\nThe new F 900 XR offers more touring capability and long-distance comfort thanks to optimized aerodynamics in the front fairing. The redesigned wind deflector reduces wind pressure on the rider, resulting in significantly less helmet buffeting and even greater riding comfort.\n\nThe hand protectors, which are standard for all equipment variants, also provides improved protection from the wind and weather. The new F 900 XR can also be fitted with a new, optional 1.18-inch higher windscreen.\n\nStandard and Optional Equipment\n\nLike all 2025 model year BMW motorcycle models, the new F 900 R and F 900 XR include the Ultimate Care Break-In Service, or “600 Mile Service” as standard. This included service further provides BMW customers with a truly premium experience. Time and mileage limits apply – maximum 6 months from the in-service date or maximum 750 miles – whichever comes first.',

        'content': 'Pilot announced for Bluebird\'s return to water\n\nGetty Images It is six years since Bluebird was in action at Loch Fad on the Isle of Bute\n\nDonald Campbell\'s restored Bluebird K7 is to be piloted by the son of a world-record holder when it returns to the water. The hydroplane was destroyed in 1967 when Campbell crashed in the Lake District as he attempted to push his own water speed record past 300mph (480km/h). Having been recovered from the bottom of Coniston Water 34 years later, it was rebuilt by a team of engineers on Tyneside. After a long-running ownership row, it was handed over to the Ruskin Museum, and now bosses say Australian Dave Warby, son of the late-water speed world-record holder Ken Warby, will be in the cockpit when it returns to the lake in 2026.\n\nMr Warby, a current world water speed record challenger, described it as a "tremendous honour". Calling Bluebird "the most iconic water speed record boat in the world", he said its exploits with Campbell at the controls had been the "inspiration" for his father to set his own world records in 1977 and 1978. His latter mark of 317mph (510km/h) still stands.\n\nDave Warby Dave Warby is aiming to break the water speed record in his own craft, Spirit of Australia II\n\nMr Warby\'s reserve will be RAF Flt Lt David-John Gibbs, from Grantham, Lincolnshire, who is the designated pilot for the Longbow speed record attempt being led by Dave Aldred. Two Orpheus jet engines are to be refurbished as part of the plans to get Bluebird running again. Donald Campbell\'s Bluebird: The battle back to Coniston Setting seven world water speed records between 1955 and 1964, it was last on water in 2018 at Loch Fad, on Scotland\'s Isle of Bute, following a restoration led by North Shields engineer Bill Smith. A legal row then ensued after Mr Smith claimed part-ownership due to the work he and his Bluebird Project (BBP) team had carried out. In the settlement agreed in January, when he relinquished his claim, Mr Smith paid £25,000 towards the Ruskin Museum\'s legal costs. It was also agreed he would have no "further right, title or interest" in the craft. However, since then the BBP\'s social media account has repeatedly called for the museum to put aside those terms and enlist the group\'s volunteers to help with maintenance and any future running.\n\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.
